,techsupport,"Hi All,

We have been looking at making a bunch of changes around here and we want everyone's help and opinion on the matter. The 3 things that we want to look at first are Rules, Flairs and the Wiki.

Please comment on the relevant thread below so it can be tidy and not messy.

# Rules!

We are in the progress of changing and re-wording the rules, you can find our rules on the new Wiki that we are building (More explained later). Please follow this link and let us know your thoughts on the rules - [https://rtech.support/books/rules/page/rules-of-the-rtechsupport-v2](https://rtech.support/books/rules/page/rules-of-the-rtechsupport-v2)

&amp;#x200B;

# Flairs!

We are looking into how we can best revamp this and make it a thing in our community again. Over the years this feature has fallen off and not much upkeep has happened. We are looking at overhauling it and creating new flares, giving new flairs out. This is for posts and members of /r/TechSupport.

If you have any ideas on this weather it is names or reasons to reward flares please let us know below.

Current user flairs are:

* **Helper Extraordinaire**
* **Windows Master**
* **System Administrator**
* **Security Expert**
* **Subreddit Supporter**
* **Programming Expert**
* **Networking Expert**
* **Linux Guru**
* **Expert Builder**
* **Backup &amp; Recovery Expert**
* **Apple Genius**

Current Post Flairs:

* Solved
* Open | Hardware

# /r/TechSupport's Wiki

Thanks for reading so far. We are looking to overhaul the Wiki and create a new one from scratch with updated relevant information. Years ago we had a wiki that was full of information but that is now lost and I doubt many would even remember it.  We have created a new Wiki on the platform called BookStack which can be found here - [https://rtech.support/](https://rtech.support/)

We would love to hear your thoughts on this platform, it is very much a work in progress and nothing really there yet but we want to build our repository of Wikis and information up.  Which also ties into the Flairs aspect, we want to ask for others to help contribute to building the Wiki. It would be advisable for you to join our Discord where you can talk to the Mods and other help in this regard and ask for peer help when creating documentation.

If you are interested in this and contributing please let us know by commenting below and we will reach out to you.

&amp;#x200B;

Anything else you want to mention not about the 3 areas mentioned here please let us know in the other comment thread. Please refrain from creating other threads. We are also exploring how we might best create templates for users and post so anything relating to this please let us know in the other feedback.

 *If you suspect you are infected with any form of malware that encrypts your files, DO NOT follow this guide! Please make a post instead. Your files are at stake.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Tip:** Windows 7 and below is no longer supported by Microsoft and UNSAFE to use. If you are still running Windows 7 with a LEGIT license, you can obtain a free upgrade to Windows 10 by using the [Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) from Microsoft. They have been very generous in continuing to allow users to upgrade from Windows 7 at no charge. *Do this upgrade AFTER your system has been cleaned of malware. A system image backup is highly recommended before starting this process. This backup can be performed to an external hard drive with the* [Backup &amp; Restore tool](https://i.imgur.com/B0I3FgI.png) *located in the Control Panel on Windows 7 and up.*

 

**Purpose &amp; Scope of this Guide:**

This guide is designed to assist you in removing malware from an infected system *that successfully boots*. If your computer is completely unable to boot due to malware, please make a post, as this guide will not help you. If you perform the following steps exactly as described, this will solve your problem in over 90% of scenarios. That said, not all malware is created equal, and not all malware removal tools are created equal. The tools recommended in this guide were picked because of their high success and low failure rates, measured on a very large scale. However, there will be times that this guide fails in removing malware. If that is the case, please make a post for further assistance, stating that this guide was unsuccessful. It is recommended to only accept advice from a “Trusted” technician. I am writing this guide in layman’s terms so that most people will be able to understand it with ease.

 

**Disclaimer:**

The following instructions are recommendations only. You take full responsibility for any steps you choose to perform on your computer. While the following recommendations are performed without issue on countless machines, there is always a risk of damaging your Operating System or experiencing data loss on any machine. **It is solely YOUR responsibility to save all work and back up any and all important data on your system before proceeding.** 

 

**Malware Remediation Steps:**

*Before proceeding, go into your browser’s extensions and remove all suspicious items. Also go into your browser’s settings and remove any default search providers and unusual homepages. If you are unsure how to do this, proceed to Step 1.*

 

*Download and run the following tools in this order. Run all tools unless otherwise instructed. All tools should be run in Normal Mode (not Safe Mode) unless you are unable to boot Normal Mode, or the scans fail in Normal Mode. All tools must be run under an Administrator account. Do not remove any tool-generated logs in the event a helper needs you to post them to further assist you.*

 

**1) Run** [**rkill.com**](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/dl/10/)**. Sometimes it takes a few minutes to finish. Do not reboot when done.**

* Kills running malicious processes
* Removes policies in the registry that prevent normal OS operation
* Repairs file extension hijacks

 

**2) Download an updated copy** [**Malwarebytes 4.0**](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/thankyou/)**. Turn on the “**[**Scan for Rootkits**](https://i.imgur.com/5lLJB3R.png)**” option. Then, run a “**[**Scan**](https://i.imgur.com/fDFSVy4.png)**”**

* Successfully removes the vast majority of infections
* Has an industry-leading, lightning fast scanning  &amp; heuristics engine
* Has built-in repair tools to fix damage done by malware

 

**3) Run** [**Malwarebytes ADWCleaner 8**](https://toolslib.net/downloads/viewdownload/1-adwcleaner/) **using the “**[**Scan Now**](https://i.imgur.com/hwFbaQZ.png)**” button.**

* Removes majority of adware, PuPs, Toolbars, and Browser hijacks
* Scans for bloatware &amp; pre-installed sofware and lets you quarantine any or all of it.
* Fixes proxy settings changed by malware
* Removes certain non-default browser settings

 

 

**Optional, Advanced Step (only run if previous tools fail to solve problem):**

**4) Run Sophos** [**HitmanPro**](http://get.hitmanpro.com/)

* [Here](https://i.imgur.com/oT7CjuN.png) is HitmanPro.

HitmanPro is a phenomenal ""second-opinion"" malware scanner. I recommend clicking ""Settings"" and uncheck ""Scan for tracking cookies"" before starting the scan. This will drastically reduce scan times. This tool can only be run ONCE for free. Use it wisely.

 

**Please note:** If malware has prohibited you from browsing the web or downloading files, you can try running the [NetAdapter Repair Tool](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/netadapter-repair-all-in-one/)  with [all options checked](http://i.imgur.com/XLv1ZUW.png) which will attempt to restore your internet connection &amp; default browser settings. You may have to download these tools on another computer and move them to a flash drive that you can plug into the infected machine.

 

**Think your Mac is infected?**

Try [Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for Mac](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mac/). Please make a post if it is unsuccessful.

 

If you have run all of the above tools successfully, you should be malware-free. If you are still experiencing problems, please make a post in /r/techsupport for further assistance.

 

**Follow-up Steps (highly recommended):**

* Using a computer that has not been infected, change passwords to all your online accounts.
* Consider enabling two-factor authentication on all accounts!
* Install a better anti-virus. See recommendations below.

 

**What is malware?**

[Malware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware) is an umbrella term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software, including computer viruses, worms, trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, scareware, and other malicious programs. It can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software. \[Source: Wikipedia.com\]

 

**How did I get infected?**

It is difficult to track down the source of an infection. Most infections are actually given permission to run unknowingly by the user. It is recommended to keep User Account Control turned on and never give access to something you do not trust or did not open. Many other infections come via exploits in your browser or browser plug-ins on websites you visit. Always be very careful what you install. Make sure you trust the source implicitly. When downloading programs, always use the publisher’s website directly.

 

**How to prevent future infections:**

Be very careful what you download and install. Keep your software up-to-date. Using [Ninite](http://ninite.com) for installing/updating software is very easy &amp; safe and uses official installers without adding extra software to your PC during installation. Make sure Windows is kept up-to-date as well, including Windows 10 feature updates. Many Windows updates patch exploits and vulnerabilities in your operating system. Most infections are active because the user has unknowingly given it Administrative permission to install and run. The first line of defense starts with you.

 

**The following tools will aide you in keeping your computer clean:**

 

**Free Anti-Virus Suggestions:**

* [Malwarebytes 4.0](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/thankyou/) (Next-generation anti-virus replacement, free version must be run MANUALLY)
* [BitDefender](http://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/free.html)
* [ESET Free Online Scanner](http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/)

Free AVs will only go so far. I highly recommend purchasing the AV of your choice to get better protection. Companies who offer products for free are usually making money off you one way or another. This has been [proven again recently with Avast](https://www.cnet.com/news/antivirus-firm-avast-is-reportedly-selling-users-web-browsing-data/). If you use Avast, uninstall it immediately.

**Helpful Tools:**

* [Malwarebytes 4.0](https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/) (Next-generation anti-virus replacement)
* [uBlock Origin Browser Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) (Blocks ads)",t2_a86x4,False,,3,False,[SUGGESTED READING] Official Malware Removal Guide,[],r/techsupport,,False,6,solved,0,,,False,t3_33evdi,False,dark,0.99,,public,1125,19,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Guide or Suggestion,False,1125,,False,self,1583776446.0,trusted wikipedia-w,[],"{'gid_1': 3, 'gid_2': 3}",,True,,1429687315.0,text,6,,,text,self.techsupport,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Official Malware Removal Guide&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optional, Advanced Step (only run if previous tools fail to solve problem):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Run Sophos&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""http://get.hitmanpro.com/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HitmanPro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/oT7CjuN.png""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is HitmanPro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HitmanPro is a phenomenal &amp;quot;second-opinion&amp;quot; malware scanner. I recommend clicking &amp;quot;Settings&amp;quot; and uncheck &amp;quot;Scan for tracking cookies&amp;quot; before starting the scan. This will drastically reduce scan times. This tool can only be run ONCE for free. Use it wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;/strong&gt; If malware has prohibited you from browsing the web or downloading files, you can try running the &lt;a href=""http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/netadapter-repair-all-in-one/""&gt;NetAdapter Repair Tool&lt;/a&gt;  with &lt;a href=""http://i.imgur.com/XLv1ZUW.png""&gt;all options checked&lt;/a&gt; which will attempt to restore your internet connection &amp;amp; default browser settings. You may have to download these tools on another computer and move them to a flash drive that you can plug into the infected machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think your Mac is infected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try &lt;a href=""https://www.malwarebytes.com/mac/""&gt;Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for Mac&lt;/a&gt;. Please make a post if it is unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have run all of the above tools successfully, you should be malware-free. If you are still experiencing problems, please make a post in &lt;a href=""/r/techsupport""&gt;/r/techsupport&lt;/a&gt; for further assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow-up Steps (highly recommended):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a computer that has not been infected, change passwords to all your online accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider enabling two-factor authentication on all accounts!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install a better anti-virus. See recommendations below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is malware?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware""&gt;Malware&lt;/a&gt; is an umbrella term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software, including computer viruses, worms, trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, scareware, and other malicious programs. It can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software. [Source: Wikipedia.com]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did I get infected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to track down the source of an infection. Most infections are actually given permission to run unknowingly by the user. It is recommended to keep User Account Control turned on and never give access to something you do not trust or did not open. Many other infections come via exploits in your browser or browser plug-ins on websites you visit. Always be very careful what you install. Make sure you trust the source implicitly. When downloading programs, always use the publisher’s website directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to prevent future infections:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be very careful what you download and install. Keep your software up-to-date. Using &lt;a href=""http://ninite.com""&gt;Ninite&lt;/a&gt; for installing/updating software is very easy &amp;amp; safe and uses official installers without adding extra software to your PC during installation. Make sure Windows is kept up-to-date as well, including Windows 10 feature updates. Many Windows updates patch exploits and vulnerabilities in your operating system. Most infections are active because the user has unknowingly given it Administrative permission to install and run. The first line of defense starts with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The following tools will aide you in keeping your computer clean:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free Anti-Virus Suggestions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/thankyou/""&gt;Malwarebytes 4.0&lt;/a&gt; (Next-generation anti-virus replacement, free version must be run MANUALLY)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/free.html""&gt;BitDefender&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/""&gt;ESET Free Online Scanner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free AVs will only go so far. I highly recommend purchasing the AV of your choice to get better protection. Companies who offer products for free are usually making money off you one way or another. This has been &lt;a href=""https://www.cnet.com/news/antivirus-firm-avast-is-reportedly-selling-users-web-browsing-data/""&gt;proven again recently with Avast&lt;/a&gt;. If you use Avast, uninstall it immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helpful Tools:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

My Windows 10 computer has been unusably slow due to 100% disk use as shown in the task manager. The top results for Disk use inntask manager are System, Registry, and a lot of items that start with Service Host. 

I thought maybe the reason was that my PC needed an update, so I tried installing them, which took all day. I thought it was working until it said:

""There were some problems installing some updates."" 

I think maybe the updating software became corrupted somehow. I tried some solution I found online requiring the Services app, but the computer's so slow that I cant even open it. 

Ive done about four different scans for malware and found nothing, and I'm not sure how I could have picked up malware anyways. I think its some kinda bug with the updating software.

,techsupport,"Hi,

Last night I was working on my PC and turned it off. Today when I tried to turn it on I got no signal, no post or nothing.

I think the problem might be the motherboard (Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E), because the LEDs stopped working a while ago, and some weeks ago I noticed some of the RAM slots are not working. But I'm not sure how to confirm it.

To test what might be faulty I started disconnecting components from the MB to see if after disconnecting something I might get some kind of signal on the monitor, so right now the motherboard it's just connected with the CPU, front chassis fans and PSU and still no signal.

Also while disconnecting components I noticed my CPU cooling and CPU look like this but I don't know if that's normal:

So, here is what happened, I was learning how to use the IAM tool to add groups and users as well as permissions to each user within the groups I had created, I created a fake Information Technology group and added myself and a few dummy users in another fake group then added tags so i was easier to find. The stupid thing was...I used the same username and password I would have used for my user account (rookie mistake I know) and went to the login link for the fake me i had created with the AWSadmin permission for the dummy account. Everything was great until the instructor told me to delete the dummy user and now when i log back into my root account on my AWS server I am unable to add myself, users, or any kind of group. I also guess i changed my password so now I have to use the dummy password to login to my root account. 

The error message I get is : ""user/(blank) is not authorized to perform: iam:GetAccountSummary on resource"". I used blank so that I do not give out any of my cloud information

To say nothing of the fact that I can&amp;#39;t afford it right now anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of this is that it takes quite a while to download... basically anything. And while anything is downloading, it chews up the whole connection and everything else on the network behaves as though the internet is out. I would prefer not to disrupt my relative&amp;#39;s online activities on a regular basis, but sometimes downloading things is unavoidable. Any ideas for potential solutions?&lt;/p&gt;

,techsupport,"Hi there - hopefully somebody with some expertise can help me out.

I am having some persistent issues with a nearly ten year old PC.

Specs (I know, it should be in the Smithsonian...):

Operating System: Windows 10 Home 64-bit (10.0, Build 19042 (19041.vb_release.191206-1406)
Language: English (Regional Setting: English)
Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600K CPU @ 3.40GHz (8 CPUs), ~3.4GHz
Memory: 8192MB RAM
Available OS Memory: 8160MB RAM
Page File: 5659MB used, 10692MB available
DirectX Version: DirectX 12

Graphics card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 Ti
Driver version: 23.21.13.9135 (NVIDIA 391.35)

Motherboard: ASUS P8P67 PRO
BIOS Date: 11/01/12 09:41:04 Ver: 36.02

PSU: Corsair TX750W


The issue:

Graphics-related. Issue seemed to start shortly after upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10 in August. The PC constantly freezes, sometimes with some artifacts on the monitor - hard disk continues to make noise for a while, fans continue to run, mouse doesn't respond to movements, num/caps lock lights on keyboard don't change on key press. Only fix is to hold power button and restart. Sometimes it automatically restarts, but usually not. Sometimes this happens on the sign in page for Windows 10 (there are usually a few prominent bright pixels at the top of the screen, followed by a freeze), sometimes it will load Windows and will work for a short time. The test image in NVIDIA control panel has artifacts (black rectangles), but typically settle after 10 seconds or so. If it doesn't crash of its own accord, I can make it crash by running a PCIe render test in GPU-Z, or by doing literally anything else for about 3 minutes.

The machine will run at length (numerous days) without crashing if i disable the display adaptor from device manager. There is some occasional audio stuttering if I do so.

Things I have tried to fix it:

* cleaned some dust from the case and from the dust filters on the case fans - no improvement (and I don't think temps were an issue anyway)
* removed the card, cleaned some dust from it with compressed air (carefully), reseated it. Same with the 2x 4GB RAM sticks - no improvement
* have run system file checker dozens of times (a couple of times, months ago, it has found and fixed errors, but I wondered if that wasn't due to the continuous hard resetting of the machine after a crash)
* ran full virus scan with Defender and Malwarebytes - no issues
* check disk utility run numerous times - no issues
* run the Windows memory diagnostic test for a few short cycles and two longer ones (overnight) - no issues. Haven't used a commercial memtest.
* uninstalled all display drivers with DDU and reinstalled in various ways, manually via the NVIDIA website, via GeForce Experience and by letting Windows Update do whatever it wants - no improvement
* Used an older driver that Windows Update wanted to use and not the latest  NVIDIA
recommended one - no improvement
* Intel Driver Assistant has no updates for me to install
* turned off quick boot - no improvement
* disabled all non-Microsoft drivers - no improvement
* flashed motherboard and video BIOSes - no improvement
* reset Windows - no improvement
* downloaded a Windows installation media from Microsoft and performed a fresh reinstall with new partitions - twice - improvement the first time (for about 36 hours) before the problem reappeared, no change the second time

Other issues which I am not sure are related, but you guys would know better than me:

* the driver for my CPU fan has been disabled in device manager (code 22), but seems to be working anyway - and causes a blue screen (Page Fault in Non-Paged Area) when i enable it. (As far as I can tell, all the entries in my dump file are to do with this - nothing useful about the more general problem, I guess because it just crashes rather than blue screens and doesn't write a file). Think this is a recent issue as it was fine until a couple of weeks ago.
* A couple of days ago (and this was a one off) the PC shut down when i was AFK and when I came back and restarted, fans ran but during POST there was a red LED on the motherboard by the memory slots. I checked they were seated properly and after a couple of further restarts the problem went away (fingers crossed) - has not happened before or since.

Am self-isolating because of the 'rona, so can't get easily hold of another card to see if it works, and can't test my card in another machine.

Rapidly running out of ideas - anyone have any thoughts before I bite the bullet and buy a new card? The only thing stopping me is that this was never an issue with Windows 7 (pre-August), but i think it worked pretty much fine for the first couple of weeks after upgrading, so am guessing it's just a coincindence.

,techsupport,"I built an Opiplex 990 gaming PC for my friend. I've built my own PC and i run Manjaro linux, so i'd consider myself fairly knowledgeable on this sort of stuff, but i need some help. Sounds cocky, i know.

Specs: (Not the best CPU or amount of ram, i know)

* i5-2400.
* GTX 770.
* 8Gb ram.
* 250gb SSD.
* 1TB ancient hard drive that came with the Optiplex.
* 500w power supply (Possibly not enough? Still, it crashes even if it isn't using much power).

The issue:

His PCs screen will freeze, go black, and then turn on again.

In Event Viewer, he gets nvlddmkm error event 14.

When: (These are rather strange)

1. Logging into discord causes his PC to freeze entirely and need a full reboot.
2. *It does NOT* crash when he plays CS:GO, strangely. Eliminates power issues for the most part.
3. Moving mouse around quickly.
4. When first turning the system on.
5. Crashes on youtube, but it takes a while.

NOTE: The fans still spin when it crashes.

I based the possibilities from the answers from \[this\]([https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8\_1-hardware/nvidia-the-description-for-event-id-14-from-source/cc7a7b67-a812-41c8-ab2a-fd7a4ce1b588#:\~:text=Description%3A-,The%20description%20for%20Event%20ID%2014%20from%20source%20nvlddmkm%20cannot,or%20the%20installation%20is%20corrupted.&amp;text=cannot%20be%20found.-,Either%20the%20component%20that%20raises%20this%20event%20is%20not%20installed,or%20the%20installation%20is%20corrupted](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-hardware/nvidia-the-description-for-event-id-14-from-source/cc7a7b67-a812-41c8-ab2a-fd7a4ce1b588#:~:text=Description%3A-,The%20description%20for%20Event%20ID%2014%20from%20source%20nvlddmkm%20cannot,or%20the%20installation%20is%20corrupted.&amp;text=cannot%20be%20found.-,Either%20the%20component%20that%20raises%20this%20event%20is%20not%20installed,or%20the%20installation%20is%20corrupted))

Possibilities not proven likely or unlikely:

* Faulty graphics card
* Incorrect motherboard voltages
* Problematic PSU
* Incorrect memory timings or voltages
* Bad PCI-E slot
* Bad memory or GPU clocks

Possibilities proven very unlikely:

* Overheating (it crashes when cool and on startup).

I&amp;#39;ve built my own PC and i run Manjaro linux, so i&amp;#39;d consider myself fairly knowledgeable on this sort of stuff, but i need some help. Sounds cocky, i know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specs: (Not the best CPU or amount of ram, i know)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i5-2400.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GTX 770.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8Gb ram.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;250gb SSD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1TB ancient hard drive that came with the Optiplex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;500w power supply (Possibly not enough? Still, it crashes even if it isn&amp;#39;t using much power).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His PCs screen will freeze, go black, and then turn on again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Event Viewer, he gets nvlddmkm error event 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When: (These are rather strange)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logging into discord causes his PC to freeze entirely and need a full reboot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;It does NOT&lt;/em&gt; crash when he plays CS:GO, strangely. Eliminates power issues for the most part.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibilities not proven likely or unlikely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faulty graphics card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorrect motherboard voltages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problematic PSU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorrect memory timings or voltages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad PCI-E slot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad memory or GPU clocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibilities proven very unlikely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overheating (it crashes when cool and on startup).&lt;/li&gt;

What fps am i supposed to run gta v at with a rtx 2070 and an i5 9400f because I don't think it's an average of 70 to 80 in story mode and an average of 50 to 60 in online mode with drops to even 30.

My biggest concern is that when I initially installed gta on my 3 month old rig it ran on a capped 144 in story with a few drops online to just 120, letting me no room for understanding of the downgrade.

In both times I played gta I had everything maxed out on 1080p. I observed some bottleneck issues at some point when the GPU was using only 60% to 70% but today the usage went fine to a degree. I heard gta may be cpu intensive but the cpu wasn't working too hard either ( around 50 % ). 

In adition to that I encountered a sort of horizontal flickering of translucid lines constantly going up. Another issue that could be related to the monitor is a weird occurance of small formations of black dots. These ones I encountered in rdr 2 when disabling taaand looking at the sun and in witcher 3 when looking at bright textures such as snow. Now I don't know if this issue is gpu or monitor related.

&lt;p&gt;My biggest concern is that when I initially installed gta on my 3 month old rig it ran on a capped 144 in story with a few drops online to just 120, letting me no room for understanding of the downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both times I played gta I had everything maxed out on 1080p. I observed some bottleneck issues at some point when the GPU was using only 60% to 70% but today the usage went fine to a degree. I heard gta may be cpu intensive but the cpu wasn&amp;#39;t working too hard either ( around 50 % ). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In adition to that I encountered a sort of horizontal flickering of translucid lines constantly going up. Another issue that could be related to the monitor is a weird occurance of small formations of black dots. These ones I encountered in rdr 2 when disabling taaand looking at the sun and in witcher 3 when looking at bright textures such as snow. Now I don&amp;#39;t know if this issue is gpu or monitor related. It&amp;#39;s a 4 year old monitor but i find it hard to believe a monitor would go bad.

Everything is 1 month old.

Computer started throwing KMod Exception Not Handled BSOD without any driver name around every 15 min. When looking at the dump file,  ntkrnlmp.exe was throwing the exception and the program that crashed varied from Discord to drivers. I checked my RAM with memtest86 and everything was fine. I started updating all the drivers but it did not help. I reset the windows to a restore point from 2 days prior and the error still persisted.

While trying to find some solution, it started throwing Bad\_Config\_Info and would not open. It also did not open in safe mode. I reset it again to that restore point and all worked fine for 10 minutes until another KMod Exception BSOD came.

I unplugged the CMOS battery, GPU and RAM just to be sure. When ram was in position 2 and 4, it opened and gave the KMod Exception, when I moved the ram into the 1 and 3 position, the debug light indicated that the CPU was not detected and it failed to post. After moving back, it opened.

I decided to create a windows setup usb and reinstall windows. It reinstalled but it again started throwing the KMod Exception.

Also, not sure if important but Task Manager started showing weird CPU details, like 9967711.83 GHz and always 100% utilization. The problem persisted in core temp but in the Ryzen Master app it was fine.

Edit: After trying to reverse the RAM again, it posted. It fails to post at random times.

So I've got this weird thing going on with may laptop:

As mentioned I have a Lenovo Legion Y520 laptop and a few weeks ago I've opened it to clean the dust off. Nothing fancy just using an air compressor on lowest setting as usually (I've done this dozen of times in the past). After I've finished tried to power the laptop ON, the keyboard lighted up and the fans were spinning but there was no video output. Tried an external monitor got the same result. Tried  to flush the static (hold down the power button for \~45 second &lt; tried with all possible combinations w/ or w/out the plug w/ or w/out the battery&gt;). However accidentally I've unplugged the track pad from the MB and this time it had video output. When I've connected the TP back and tried to boot again the video was out again. I tried something (I don't know if it's stupid or not) but when I had the video output on I've connected the TP ( with the laptop on) and it don't crash on the contrary I had both video output and a TP. I've re-installed windows (and it went through multiple restarts) and everything looked promising so far...that until I've turned off my laptop and tried to power it back on the next day... guess who was back? Well not my video signal. 

I tried to find anything online but no results. I can't be the only one to have this issue.

As title says I do have an old LGA 1150 motherboard.

[&gt; Motherboard &lt;](https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/SABERTOOTH_Z97_MARK_1/)


This is what happened: I have bought an NVME drive for my PC, knowing that it dies not support it, I have also bought a PCIe x4 extension card 

[&gt; Extension Card &lt;](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JJTVGZM/)


I am aware that the motherboard does not have an x4 slot, but I figured I could just use  the x16 slot instead.


Upon installing the card and NVME, only BIOS recognized it, windows did not do anything.

I have downloaded the driver from Samsung's website and  tried to install it. I
After around 30 minutes it was not finished.

Another 90 minutes have passed and nothing happened still, so I have tried to restart the PC normally. It hang on ""restarting"" screen for eternity as well,  so, after  almost 5 hours I have reset it via the button.


Windows is in continuous BSOD loop if I have the NVME installed. BIOS continues to recognize it without any issue, although driver info menu option is disabled  in the menu.

The BSOD is ""Critical Service Failed"", and keeps rebooting.

Once it hits ""Automatic Repair"", it never loads either.

Tried many things involving installing the card after AR finished loading without it (installed it carefully while in the menu before the restart), then selecting no signature enforcement...same issue.


If you look at the Motherboard's picture


The 

WHITE slot has my video card

BROWN slot has my expansion card

BLACK slot is empty (also tried extension card here, same outcome)


* I have re-seated the expansion card multiple times, and BIOS always recognizes it. 

* I have also tried to reset it to default settings, no dice

* I have tried to disable all entries of the NVME drive boot options 

* the driver does not show up on installed programs or device manager

* taking out the NVME card makes windows boot normally without fail

Hi there,

Looking for some help with my Alienware 17 R4, getting hopeless. Although I've made slight improvements with things like changing options in bios, throttlestop disabling BD PROCHOT, undervolting, changing power management percentage, monitoring temps and usuage using mwinfo etc etc etc. So It appears when I clock my 2.8ghz to 3.5-3.6ghz I get the same performance in HEAVEN benchmark as when it's at 2.8, except my temps get up to over 90 degrees celcius. So that's why I put my power management down to 85-90%, and my temps remain in the 80s, and my performance is very similar.

I don't quite seem to be getting the same performance I use to be getting while gaming (warzone and pubg).

Just today I ran LatencyMon and noticed I Was getting some really high numbers, so I disabled a couple dell drivers and seen the battery ACPI was giving me high numbers so I disabled that. That seemed to improve performance slightly, but doing all this seems like its just a bandage to my situation and I'm not resolving the root cause. Considering I use to get much better performance, I'm not sure what it could be.

My 17 R4 specs are as followed;  
AMD Radeon(TM) RX 570 with 8GB GDDR5  
16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 at 2400MHz  
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ (Q uad-Core, 6MB Cache, up to 3.8 GHz w/ Turbo Boost)  
SSD harddrive

Desperate for some help, i've spent so much time trying to fix this!

,techsupport,"Hey Everyone, 

I've recently built my first PC! It's been running smoothly with the exception of one issue. There's a seemingly random issue where my devices (keyboard, mouse, etc.) will stop working and my monitor will lose signal shortly thereafter. However by simply unplugging and plugging back in the the (Monitor) HDMI cable to the GPU the issue is resolved. It may seem like a non-issue but it's extremely annoying. I also stream and play games and it would suck for this to happen in the middle of that.

Sometimes it will happen a couple times when running my PC, sometimes it won't happen at all. It's extremely random. I'm also not doing anything that would stress my components out. I'll play Total War Warhammer II on high/ultra settings for hours and be fine but I'll be reading something on Google or watching a YouTube video and this issue will occur. I have tried to look up answers to this issue on forums but I can't seem to find any solutions. I've uninstalled and clean reinstalled my GPU Drivers, and have made sure everything else is up to date unless I'm missing something. I am new to this PC stuff so any help would be greatly appreciated!

Here are my PC Specs for Reference:

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve recently built my first PC! It&amp;#39;s been running smoothly with the exception of one issue. There&amp;#39;s a seemingly random issue where my devices (keyboard, mouse, etc.) will stop working and my monitor will lose signal shortly thereafter. However by simply unplugging and plugging back in the the (Monitor) HDMI cable to the GPU the issue is resolved. It may seem like a non-issue but it&amp;#39;s extremely annoying. I also stream and play games and it would suck for this to happen in the middle of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it will happen a couple times when running my PC, sometimes it won&amp;#39;t happen at all. It&amp;#39;s extremely random. I&amp;#39;m also not doing anything that would stress my components out. I&amp;#39;ll play Total War Warhammer II on high/ultra settings for hours and be fine but I&amp;#39;ll be reading something on Google or watching a YouTube video and this issue will occur. I have tried to look up answers to this issue on forums but I can&amp;#39;t seem to find any solutions. I&amp;#39;ve uninstalled and clean reinstalled my GPU Drivers, and have made sure everything else is up to date unless I&amp;#39;m missing something. I am new to this PC stuff so any help would be greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

Recently I got a Netgear Nighthawk modem/router. For whatever reason, when I plug in the Ethernet cable to my PC, it freezes and then just turns off.

,techsupport,"Hi There,

I've recently been experiencing fairly constant BSODs. It's generally when gaming (WoW) and will occur early into a session - i.e. 15-20 minutes. My PC will then BSOD on startup multiple times and I need to continue rebooting. I usually need to continuously reboot, open the game I'm trying to play for about an hour. Eventually, it will allow me to play games including WoW for hours with no BSODs. 

The next day this will repeat. It seems that if the PC is off for more than a few hours this BSOD loop resets.

The BSOD error messages include a (seemingly random) assortment of:

SYSTEM SERVICE EXCEPTION  
KMODE EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED  
KERNEL SECURITY CHECK FAILURE  
PAGE FAULT IN NONPAGED AREA  
DRIVER IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL

and there are a variety of drivers/modules that the BSOD specifies, including unknown(0x0000), ntoskrnl.exe and partmgr.sys.

I've tried pretty much everything I can find online including Memtest (all night no issues), CHKDSK, DISM, SFC Scannow, BIOS Update, dislodging memory/GPU and relodging, all windows updates.

I can't specify any drivers that are causing the issue.

I've also run various Whocrashed tests to try and identify the drivers that are causing issues.  
The note on WhoCrashed is generally the following:   
This indicates that an exception happened while executing a routine that  transitions from non-privileged code to privileged code.   
This appears to be  a typical software driver bug and is not likely to be caused by a hardware  problem.   
A third party driver was identified as the probable root cause of  this system error.

&lt;p&gt;The next day this will repeat. It seems that if the PC is off for more than a few hours this BSOD loop resets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BSOD error messages include a (seemingly random) assortment of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SYSTEM SERVICE EXCEPTION&lt;br/&gt;
KMODE EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED&lt;br/&gt;
KERNEL SECURITY CHECK FAILURE&lt;br/&gt;
PAGE FAULT IN NONPAGED AREA&lt;br/&gt;
DRIVER IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and there are a variety of drivers/modules that the BSOD specifies, including unknown(0x0000), ntoskrnl.exe and partmgr.sys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried pretty much everything I can find online including Memtest (all night no issues), CHKDSK, DISM, SFC Scannow, BIOS Update, dislodging memory/GPU and relodging, all windows updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t specify any drivers that are causing the issue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer name:  DESKTOP-BORG14P&lt;br/&gt;
Windows version: Windows 10, 10.0, version 2004, build:  19041&lt;br/&gt;
Windows dir: C:\WINDOWS&lt;br/&gt;
Hardware: MS-7B89, Micro-Star International  Co., Ltd., B450M MORTAR MAX (MS-7B89)&lt;br/&gt;
CPU: AuthenticAMD AMD Ryzen 5 3600X  6-Core Processor 8664, level: 23&lt;br/&gt;
12 logical processors, active mask:  4095&lt;br/&gt;
GPU: RTX Geforce 2070&lt;br/&gt;
RAM: 17126543360 bytes (16.0GB)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also run various Whocrashed tests to try and identify the drivers that are causing issues.&lt;br/&gt;
The note on WhoCrashed is generally the following:&lt;br/&gt;
This indicates that an exception happened while executing a routine that  transitions from non-privileged code to privileged code.&lt;br/&gt;
This appears to be  a typical software driver bug and is not likely to be caused by a hardware  problem.&lt;br/&gt;
A third party driver was identified as the probable root cause of  this system error. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone please help me? Let me know if I can provide any more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

###Troubleshooting Help:

**What is your parts list? [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp)**

Built by myself several years ago...

* CPU: Intel i5 4690k
* CPU Cooler: Corsair water cooled (don't remember exact model)
* Motherboard: ASUS Z97-AR
* GPU: AMD R9 390
* PSU: EVGA NEX750B
* RAM: 4x 4GB DDR3

**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

I was browsing the web and my PC froze. I had to hard-shutdown. Now it won't turn on. When pressing the power button, the fans (PSU fan and CPU case fan) spin for about a half second, the nothing. A second or two later it does it again. This keep repeating over and over until I turn off the power supply.

**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

* Performed power supply paper clip test - succeeded, so I don't think the power supply is at fault. Issue resumed when I plugged the power supply ATX cable back into the mobo.
* Unplugged basically everything from the mobo in an attempt to isolate the issue to another part
  * Disconnected all peripherals
  * Removed sound card
  * Disconnected hard drives
  * Disconnected GPU
  * Removed RAM - also tested with only one stick in slot 1
* Tried various power outlets
* Tested with new mobo CMOS battery


**Post relevant photos of build/parts here.**

[Imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/dIXC0GR) with video of the issue. [Direct link](https://i.imgur.com/6fMKpGu.mp4) in case that doesn't work.

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

I suspect my mobo is dead due to the successful PSU paper clip test. I'm just a little confused as to why the mobo power light stays on.

Either that or a random short somewhere. The short seems unlikely though considering my PC doesn't ever really move. 

Maybe a CPU issue? I'm not really sure what to debug there.

I've also never had any issues since I built this in 2015.

I am a long time windows user and novice PC builder. I’m on my 4th build, which I’ve had now for a year. As of late my pc has been freezing up completely (mouse frozen, all tasks frozen), restarting randomly, and just now it froze mid shut down, with graphical errors appearing across the screen.

I have an 
Corsair RM850X PSU about 4 years old)

RYZEN 7 2700x 
AMD RX 5700XT (Sapphire Pulse)
32 GGB DDR 4 ram Oloy 
1 500gb Samsung 970 EVO NVME Drive in my upper M.2 slot with the motherboard heatsink installed (My OS) 
1tb intel Nvme drive in the lower M.2 slot
1 tb Samsung 950 EVO SSD (about 3 years old)
1 tb micro center store brand SSD 
And finally a 2TB barracuda HDD 

I’m using a Corsair h60 liquid cooling unit
And 7 case fans arranged around the system(I followed some directional guides)

I’m aware that this usually is due to an overheat (as it has been in the past), but I’ve been monitoring everything and they are all running at reasonable temps. The only thing that seems to be running hot is my 970 EVO at 50-55c on Samsung magician. I worried that it might be causing the crash as my OS is on that drive. But I read that that shouldn’t be too much of an issue and shouldn’t cause this.

Any ideas? All of my hardware is about a year old (bought last Black Friday) with the one exception of my Samsung 950 SSD.

,techsupport,"I've recently noticed that the temps of my CPU skyrocket to 80-90C° some time after booting my computer and go back down to around 35-40C° once I open the task manager (note that when I open task manager, the CPU usage is at 100%, but it freezes for a second and then goes back to whatever percentage it was before). I admit I haven't put my own thermal paste on the CPU and just left the stock one, but I didn't encounter any problem with temperature until about a week ago, and I've had this desktop for around three months now.

Also, I've noticed that idle temps are often around the 35-40 mark, which is weird cause those are the same temps I get when I'm browsing on Chrome or doing Zoom meetings. Whenever I'm working with a more consuming software such as Cubase or Photoshop, the temps don't usually go above 60. Is this normal or should I be preoccupied?

Also also, is it possible that it's a thermal paste/stock cooler problem, or could it be something more practical like dust or poor air flow?

,techsupport,"Hey guys, 

Owner of a brand new LG OLED55CX6 here. I'm running into a audio problem. Hopefuly this is the right place for this question. 

As you can see in the diagram ([https://imgur.com/a/MpSaebP](https://imgur.com/a/MpSaebP));

I'm connecting my NVIDIA Shield to a HDMI 2.0 Splitter which is connected to two LG tv's (LG 55UH850V, LG OLED55CX6), This part works great and I'm having no issues whatsoever. 

The issue is with the audio/sound system I'm trying to connect to the whole setup. I bought a Optical SWITCH, which is connected to a Logitech Z-5500. Input 1 is connected to one of the televisions and Input 2 is connected to the other. The sound system works great with the LG 55UH850V but doesn't work with the LG OLED55CX6. 

I have tried different inputs and made sure to check which input is active on the optical switch. I also made sure to check the settings on both tv's. Both tv's were on Optical output. I checked both optical cables. **Also most important, when connecting the LG OLED55CX6 directly to my Logitech Z-5500 with the same optical cable it works fine.** 

Side note: I ofcourse checked to see if the LG 55UH850V was turned off, if it would work but sadly no.

Fixes that I've tried so far:

1. ""sfc /scannow"" in cmd
2. DDU'd my GPU's drivers and reinstalled them
3. Reseated my ram
4. Ran the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool (nothing came up here)
5. Ran DISM Commands 

I've also tried using WhoCrashed to check which drivers have been crashing my computer, and it says **amdkmdag.sys** (ATI Radeon Kernel Mode Driver, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.) was identified to be the cause of the system crashes, which is why I uninstalled, reinstalled and updated those drivers. Unfortunately I'm still crashing even after those three.

These modules were also identified to be crashing my pc lately:
amdkmdag.sys, dxmmsg2.sys, ntkrnlmp.exe and ntoskrnl.exe

,techsupport," The other day I noticed all my USB devices stopped working (mouse, keyboard, etc). I had to unplug and re plug them all into my PC.

No big deal until today when I went to go change my RGB in Cam and I realized now that none of my RGB devices are showing up in CAM. Instead it says ""No supported lighting devices found"".

Has this happened to anyone before? I assumed it was related to the USB issue so I tried unplugging all the cables on the NZXT Hue + and where the cooler connects to the MOBO. I think I found all the right cables to re-plug but it still won't show up in CAM.

I've tried re-installing CAM about 5 times now with no luck.

I unfortunately had someone build this PC for me so I'm not that familiar with the ins and outs of all the cables inside of it.

Is there a specific cable I should be looking to unplug? As far as I know I did try and replug the USB connection on the MOBO as well as re seating all the cables that plug into the HUE+.

I'm getting real sad because I can't find any solution and the Z63 screen isn't really working. Just showing a black/white reading of the liquid temps.


Edit: I was able to solve the problem by following a YouTube tutorial. I believe I just needed to use a program like Revo uninstaller to wipe any files from NZXT because once I did that and reinstalled CAM it seemed to finally work.

I would say it happens on average every 5-10 minutes, sometimes more, sometimes less. My roommate has 0 issues with this and is connected wirelessly to the same exact network. When the random lag spikes aren't happening I get perfect signal strength with the max speed that my ISP provides perfectly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are all of the things I have tried. And none of them have resolved my issue EXCEPT for directly hardwiring my computer to the router. That seems to fix all issues completely, however, due to certain circumstances the router is across the house and I don't want to run a cable from A to B if possible.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I tried my onboard WIFI adapter on my MoBo along with a Netgear Nighthawk adapter that I already owned.

\- I even bought another WiFi adapter to try in case mine was bad

\- I tried setting up QoS to help prioritize my computer

\- I even bought an entirely new $300 Nighthawk router

\- I went into power management on my PC and disabled the setting that allows your PC to cut power to your network adapter to conserve energy (seems like a silly setting)

\- I updated all of my drivers

\- I tried plugging in my WiFi adapter into different USB ports

&amp;#x200B;

I probably have tried even more than that throughout the several months that this has been happening but that is what comes to mind so far. No other devices in the house are having issues and I am definitely within a close enough range since everything else in the same room works perfectly.

On (every) boot the pc (so not just in-game) gets super laggy in sound and video, and sounds robotic. I, nor anyone else, have been able to figure out what the cause could be. I've tried just about anything i could google, but it was mostly advice on older slower systems, which is not my issue.

So the new clue in this mystery is that i ran HWiNFO64 to see if maybe there was a hardware issue i haven't found yet... and everything seems to be fine, but the kicker is, when i run the scan, the robot lag goes away immediately! Every time! So, what does this software do while scanning in order to solve the problem???My mind is boggled, i'm an amateur and this was my first build, and everything worked out great besides this weirdness.

Any thoughts are very welcome, whether it's having me test something or a brainstorming sesh. Sure i've been living with it for a year but i still really REALLY want to solve this lol. The damn thing even got the nickname the robot because it's been with me for so long.

A few months ago when unplugging something out of the HDMI port, I went to plug something back in (sometimes go back and forth with FireStick and PS4) and I noticed the metal piece was missing. I'm not sure of exactly what caused it. It's possible I was just too rough, but it seemed like it just randomly happened.

In the meantime, I bought a splitter for my Cable, FireStick, and PS4 which is hooked into the second HDMI port.

,techsupport,"A couple of minutes ago I experienced a somewhat concerning crash on my laptop. Everything was running buttery smooth until it suddenly made a loud ""poof"" and went black. No emergency shutdown or anything, it just went from running normally to entirely dead within less than a second, so the issue is most probably hardware related.

I'm using a Lenovo Y50-70 (running Windows 10) that I bought in April 2015 and used extensively since. Considering its age and how little care I take of it, the thing usually runs surprisingly well. Never had this problem before, in fact I can't even remember the last time I experienced any notable crashes. It might be worth mentioning that I played a game with 3D graphics when the crash happened, which is something I don't often do, so the system was under a bit more stress than usual.

After the crash I tried booting up again, but when pressing the power button, the indicator just lit up for a few seconds and then went dark again, seemingly without any intention of actually turning on. I let it rest for a minute or two before I tried again, and this time my laptop booted up just as if nothing ever happened. Didn't even get a notification telling me about the error. It has been running for roughly 30 minutes since then without giving me any trouble, but still I'm concerned since I kind of need a running computer these days.

So what do you guys think caused this problem, will it happen again, possibly causing permanent damage and if so would there be any way for me to fix it? To be honest I never replaced my laptops thermal paste and can't remember cleaning the fans either, so maybe it could have been heat-related? From the outside my laptop didn't feel too hot though, just a little more than usual. 

I was thinking about building my first desktop PC in a year or maybe two, but possibly I should consider doing that a lot sooner now?

,techsupport,"Hi there internet citizen! 

Apologies in advance for the long-winded rant but I have exhausted the extent of corporate overlord sanctioned tech support scripting and have failed to resolve my issue. The following is not meant as a criticism of any brands or companies mentioned, and I must offer my commendation for the friendly customer service representatives I spoke to, but whilst they were well-intentioned, they were ultimately unhelpful.

In a nutshell, I have purchased and installed three fairly recent games on Steam - games that my system can run well.  My first problem was that I had to run these games through Origin; EA won't let Valve run their games through the Steam client, so whenever I try to launch it through Steam it automatically opens the Origin client. This in itself wouldn't be more than a minor inconvenience, except that the Origin client will NOT recognise the game clearly installed on my harddrive. Because it is installed through Steam, the Origin client seems to think I still need to download the game, yet trying to then download the game through Origin results in one of two scenarios:

1) If not yet installed, will force install the game through Steam.

2) If already installed, says that the game could not be downloaded and to try again. 

So, running the game presents me with this unusual and insurpassable obstacle. I explained my dilemma to an EA rep who guided me through the standard uninstall/re-install procedures and some basic troubleshooting. Predictably, this did nothing except delay me further as after uninstalling the game I had to wait three days for it to download again (thank the australian internet for that). 

Eventually another EA rep helped me get one step further by guiding me through how to fix issues on STEAMS end... He advised that I should clear my download cache and repair the library folders on the Steam client, which I did. I then loaded everything back up again and SUCCESS(!) Origin no longer recognises that the game is not installed! It now just refuses to play it at all. Every time I click play it ... does nothing? Starts doing a first time set up (through steam) and then just.... nothing. Resets the Origin client and takes me back to their home page and that's it? 

I also reached out to Steam support for help but they told me that they weren't able to help - basically said I had to speak to EA or get a refund (despite me trying to get a refund in the past and being rejected because the aforementioned slow internet caused me to not finish downloading these games until their refund period had expired... this isnt the case for all of them, I am generalising, but still... i reached out for a solution, not a shoulder shrug). Makes me wonder why I can even purchase these games through Steam at all? 

If anyone has experienced this same problem and can offer a more helpful solution I would be immensely grateful - even if you haven't been able to fix it, at least I can feel validated in that it is not just me.

It has the same issue when I connect my laptop so I&amp;#39;m pretty sure it&amp;#39;s the monitor. Visually there doesn&amp;#39;t really seem to be any difference on the screen. Has anyone heard of this issue before? Is the monitor just slowly dying or is there something I can do about this? Thanks in advance for the help.&lt;/p&gt;

,techsupport,"Hello,

I've been having this issue where I experience internet connectivity issues on certain devices like ps4 and Mibox. It is quite strange because both devices can actually connect to the internet. Still, on Mibox I can't connect to Netflix while I can open Youtube. It's the same with ps4. I am certain that the ps4 connects to the internet but I can't seem to connect to the ps servers. What drives me mad is that both problems do not seem to occur when I connect to the hot spot that I open from my phone. That is why I believe the problem is either due to my internet provider or due to my router (ASUS DSL-AC750).  I tried to change the DNS settings and I've also updated the firmware of my router just in case, but no avail, the problem still persists.

My question is could this be anything else other than the thermal compound or a problem with the pump?  I just ran out of thermal compound so I would have to order some and wait several days for it to arrive or make the long trip down to Micro Center... and if it is the pump I’ll have to send it back to newegg and exchange it.  I’ve been up all night so I’m going to get some sleep so whoever replies to this I will thank when I wake up.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm having issues charging my battery. I have a Clevo WS650J. It will run just fine with no battery (AC only). It will also operate on battery power only. However, the battery does no charge when AC power is plugged in. I have tried three new batteries from different sources and it refuses to charge them. When plugged in to AC power, the battery does not discharge, but does not charge either. Oddly, if I leave it plugged into AC overnight in sleep mode, in the morning it will state 100% charged. But when the AC is removed, it goes back to the level it was at the previous day (i.e. it hasn't charged at all). I have updated all drivers (and tried removing/reinstalling the battery drivers) and even updated the BIOS. I have tried different AC adapters with the same result. I have also tried booting into Ubuntu via USB and the result is the same. I've had a quick look inside and nothing seems obviously broken or damaged. I'm out of ideas!  Currently it's acting as a desktop PC since I only have the 39% already in the battery to use without AC power.

The windows battery tray doesn’t offer much [(picture 1)](https://i.imgur.com/NP5wQJL.png). When hovered over, it says ""(plugged in)"". It does not state ""(plugged in, not charging)"", or ""(plugged in, charging)"".

Hey there,

Lately I’ve been looking to buy a external hard drive for my mother since the hard drive on her MacBook has been nearing capacity. I was wondering if anyone had some suggestions for what could be a good 1-2 TB external hard drive option. I was thinking of buying a Lacie rugged 1tb, or a WD 2tb My passport, because I own one for my personal backups and like it, but I’m not sure if it’s a drive that you could use for more that just backing up files (I want an external where you can use it as if it were a internal drive in the computer already). Could these drives be plugged in constantly for editing the documents and photo stored on the drive?

Any tips?

\- Set a device that is always on, through which I can send the magic packet via LAN, and not via internet: Raspberry (sending a command via SSH), a mini PC to access maybe with TeamViewer, or some other device.

Did someone else find himself in this situation? Do you have any other idea how to solve the problem, or maybe you can suggest me some other device to use as an intermediary, that I didn't think about (and that maybe I could have around, without having to buy a Raspberry)?

Thank you all in advance!

Suggestions have been:

* CAT6-based HDMI extender ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiovisual/comments/k0jp15/is_this_hdmi_extender_cat6_combo_viable_for_30ft/), or this [transmitter](https://www.crestron.com/Products/Video/HDMI-Solutions/HDMI-Extenders/HD-TX-101-C-E)/[receiver](https://www.crestron.com/Products/Video/HDMI-Solutions/HDMI-Extenders/HD-RX-101-C-E) combo)
* ~$200 active hybrid fiber/copper HDMI cable ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiovisual/comments/k0jp15/is_this_hdmi_extender_cat6_combo_viable_for_30ft/gdiyjo5/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiovisual/comments/k0jp15/is_this_hdmi_extender_cat6_combo_viable_for_30ft/gdk41cf/)). Note that I did try [this](https://www.club-3d.com/en/detail/2436/hdmi_2.0_4k60hz_redmere_cable_10m-32.81ft/) active cable already but it didn't work. 
* Shielded HDMI cable ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiovisual/comments/k0jp15/is_this_hdmi_extender_cat6_combo_viable_for_30ft/gdj1bim/) - not sure what this even means)
* Powered HDMI switch ([here](https://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-Blackbird-HDMI-Slim-Switch/dp/B01BOB6T4E]))

I don't mind spending a bit of money here - but if I pursued them all it'd run me like $1000, just to hook up my PC to my TV over a 30 foot distance. 

Which of these suggestions should I pursue first? And ideally for my own learning, why?

,techsupport,"The more I look into this, the less likely it seems to be possible for my setup, but I want a second opinion on what to try. 

**The Problem**
My brother and I love playing civ and we have played a lot of civ 5 and 6 together. However, his PC can barely run civ 6. His experience is heavily impacted by poor performance, and he is probably damaging his laptop when he plays.

**Boring/Expensive Solutions**
Obviously we could play hot-seat mode, or choose not to play, or buy him a new machine, or get some commercial cloud gaming service. I don't want to do these.

**The Plan**
I have a relatively beefy PC, and I want to run two instances of the game using my hardware, so we can both play at the same time. I am pretty certain from a pure hardware standpoint that the performance would be good. I have an NVidia RTX 2060 and an AMD Ryzen 5 3600X plus plenty of ram, running Windows 10. I can run civ 5 and 6 at the same time very easily, but as far as I know, steam does not support running multiple instances of any one game.

**What I Have Tried**
I tried creating a linux (Ubuntu) virtual machine using *VMware Workstation 16*. I installed steam and civ 6 on that VM, in the hopes that my brother could log in and stream the game to his laptop using that steam game streaming feature. I had to enable virtualization for my cpu in the bios, and I had some issues managing the storage for the vm, but I was able to get past those issues. This was going well until I actually tried to run the game and realized that VMware workstation did not allow for any GPU to be allocated to the VM. 

**The Question**
I have been looking for other free VM tools that could be used to create a virtual machine with a GPU. It looks like *vSphere Hypervisor* could be used for something like this, but I haven't tried it yet.

* Does this seem feasible?
* Would it even be possible to use the GPU for both the VM and the host machine at the same time?
* Is there some other way to run two instances on the same hardware (and allow for separate control inputs)?

Any other tips or experience sharing would also be appreciated.",t2_10l0bo,False,,0,False,Allocate GPU to be used in a VM and by the host at the same time.,[],r/techsupport,,False,6,open-software,0,,,False,t3_k3edxb,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Open | Software,False,1,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1606703163.0,text,6,,,text,self.techsupport,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more I look into this, the less likely it seems to be possible for my setup, but I want a second opinion on what to try. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Problem&lt;/strong&gt;
My brother and I love playing civ and we have played a lot of civ 5 and 6 together. However, his PC can barely run civ 6. His experience is heavily impacted by poor performance, and he is probably damaging his laptop when he plays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boring/Expensive Solutions&lt;/strong&gt;
Obviously we could play hot-seat mode, or choose not to play, or buy him a new machine, or get some commercial cloud gaming service. I don&amp;#39;t want to do these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Plan&lt;/strong&gt;
I have a relatively beefy PC, and I want to run two instances of the game using my hardware, so we can both play at the same time. I am pretty certain from a pure hardware standpoint that the performance would be good. I have an NVidia RTX 2060 and an AMD Ryzen 5 3600X plus plenty of ram, running Windows 10. I can run civ 5 and 6 at the same time very easily, but as far as I know, steam does not support running multiple instances of any one game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I Have Tried&lt;/strong&gt;
I tried creating a linux (Ubuntu) virtual machine using &lt;em&gt;VMware Workstation 16&lt;/em&gt;. I installed steam and civ 6 on that VM, in the hopes that my brother could log in and stream the game to his laptop using that steam game streaming feature.

,techsupport,"Hey guys,

After a bit of help here if anyone can help!

A few weeks ago, I moved my PC from one room to another. Previously it was connected via ethernet and moved it into a room that didn't have an ethernet port set up. Everything worked fine on WiFi until I set the ethernet port up and plugged the cable in. I booted it up and it showed the BSoD with the error ""Stop Code: VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE ~ What failed: amdkmdag.sys""

After a bit of research it looked like there was a graphics driver update issue. The computer would still turn on every now and then, so I uninstalled drivers and reinstalled + updated to the latest using the manufacturers website. (AMD Radeon Software Adrenaline) 

Since then, the computer hasn't been able to boot up at all. It shows the error ""stop code: 0xc00021a"" I can't boot the computer up into safe mode, it won't let me reset it, I've tried reseting bios and running the diagnostics tool but they all fail. The only thing I can get into is the command prompt.

I tried following the steps in this post here : https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3ttjp3/_/ But had no luck in completing the steps

Am I out of luck? It's a very old build but it ran the games I played and was a great work PC.

so for example, if i'm playing GTA San Andreas, Carl will suddenly act like i'm pressing one of the arrow keys (it's a different direction every time), and won't stop moving in that direction for a while. the same continues when i open up the game menu; i.e. it just endlessly scrolls thru each option in whatever direction the bug is happening that time. this has happened in other games too, but it's never happened outside of a game. it also doesn't matter whether i'm using the WASD direction keys or the arrows. for info, all games are legit, and i'm playing on a 2011 macbook with no accessories, and have never used any.

So I moved out of state a few weeks ago.  I signed up for ATT Fiber internet and had it installed.  Rather than setting up all my old devices on the new ATT wifi network, I just plugged my Google wi-fi into the new ATT router.  All of my devices connected just fine and worked just fine, so I thought I was good to go.  A few days later my neighbor asked where we moved from (she knew the general area).  She then **proceeded to tell me that all of her Apple devices have locations showing up at MY exact same old address!!??**  I was stumped.  

I tried rebooting several times, but nothing worked - so I figured I would do a hard reset.  But instead I just decided to see if I removed my Google Wifi, if it would revert back.  It did - my neighbor said just after I removed my google wifi everything was back to normal.  

One useful fact:  I believe we share the same ATT box and we both do have ATT internet service.  

This feels like a major security issue and I figured I should let someone know.  Google?  Apple?   
 ATT?  If I had just moved across town, the neighbor would have though that someone kidnapped her son because of his wrong location tracking.

,techsupport,"Hello all, weird problem with my pc yesterday. I'll try to remember everything as it happened in order, after describing what I think is relevant in my setup.

Windows 10 PC, Radeon R9 200 series gpu. HDMI goes from GPU to my Insignia TV, a Logitech 2.1 sound system is plugged into the 3.5mm audio out from the TV. It has worked well until yesterday.

I downloaded the latest Runescape directly from their website, once I started it I could hear the intro music or whatever you'd call it. It wanted to configure my settings based off my system, then it says my graphics driver is out of date. Almost surely true, since I've got it set to not update automatically. I downloaded the update straight from [AMD.com](https://AMD.com). It's now version 20.9.1. After getting that set up I decided not to play and went to Youtube. That's when I first noticed the no sound problem.It will play sound if I plug the speakers directly into the rear 3.5mm jack, but not the front jack which has worked before now.

I've reinstalled the AMD driver, went in Device Manager and updated drivers for the Realtek Digital Output and Realtek High Definition Audio. Checked the cables, used my Xbox to confirm the HDMI cable, TV, and speakers were not the issue. All of this with several hard reboots in between steps.

When I right click and open Sounds settings it lists the output device as Realtek Digital Output and shows there should be sound being played as I have a Youtube video playing in the background to alert me if something fixes the issue. Device manager lists monitor as a generic pnp monitor.

No idea what to try next. Save me Reddit; you're my only hope.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I fixed it, partially... I noticed an error icon in Device Manager by the High Definition Audio Controller. I rolled back the driver to previous version and the sound suddenly started playing through the TV. My keyboard's audio control buttons still don't work on Spotify though, unless I have Spotify in focus.

,techsupport,"Hello everyone, 

I've been looking around for a solution for this seemingly simple problem for quite a while now but just can't seem to find a solution for it. 

Here's my situation: My room is on the second floor of my family's home with our Internet Router in the basement. We life in Europe so our houses walls / floors are made out of straight concrete which makes it really hard for the wifi signal to reach basically anywhere. My room has a LAN connection to the Router so that's how my Desktop PC (that doesn't have Wifi)  is connected to the Internet. But obviously, I would still like to have a decent wifi signal for my phone, laptop, alexa, smart home devices, etc. 

So my question is: How can I use the one LAN exit in my room to provide me with a Wifi signal while still being able to connect my PC to it through LAN? 

I'm thinking there must be a single device with both a LAN input and output for this that also emits a wifi signal but I haven't been able to find something like that. I guess the alternative would be to split the lan cable into two and connect one to an access point while the other goes into my pc. But I read that with most Lan switches you can only use one of the connections at a time. 

Any help would be really appreciated. Either a link to a device similar to what I'm describing or a completely different method that I haven't thought of yet would be great.

\- Gigabyte B450m DS3H WiFi

\- AMD Ryzen 5 3500x

\- Corsair 8GB 3200 Mhz \* 2

\- GeForce GTX 1650 Super Ventus

\- Cooler Master Hyper 410R RGB Fan

\- Kingston 240GB SSD

\- Seagate 1TB HDD

Yesterday I installed Windows 10 on my computer, connected it to my home wifi, installed all the drivers and the applications I needed. All was working perfectly until today afternoon when it slowly stopped working. When I say slowly, I mean it started with a few websites, then loading the rest very slowly, and then started showing no internet completely. This whole process took around 1-2 hours.

My home WiFi is working on every other device that I have: phone, iPad, old laptop, TV etc. But its not working on my new PC. I tried 2 other connections (made my phone hotspot and I have another wireless mobile connection), and it works perfectly. Since then, I've done the below steps:

1. Network Reset
2. Deleted driver and updated driver
3. Repair windows
4. Recovered windows from yesterday
5. Clean install of windows

Yet, nothing. I pinged a random website (Facebook) and [This](https://i.imgur.com/nfYgNDd.png) is what I get. (linked to Imgur)

&lt;p&gt;- Gigabyte B450m DS3H WiFi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- AMD Ryzen 5 3500x&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Corsair 8GB 3200 Mhz * 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- GeForce GTX 1650 Super Ventus&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Cooler Master Hyper 410R RGB Fan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Kingston 240GB SSD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Seagate 1TB HDD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I installed Windows 10 on my computer, connected it to my home wifi, installed all the drivers and the applications I needed. All was working perfectly until today afternoon when it slowly stopped working. When I say slowly, I mean it started with a few websites, then loading the rest very slowly, and then started showing no internet completely. This whole process took around 1-2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My home WiFi is working on every other device that I have: phone, iPad, old laptop, TV etc. But its not working on my new PC. I tried 2 other connections (made my phone hotspot and I have another wireless mobile connection), and it works perfectly. Since then, I&amp;#39;ve done the below steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network Reset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deleted driver and updated driver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repair windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recovered windows from yesterday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean install of windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, nothing. I pinged a random website (Facebook) and &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/nfYgNDd.png""&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is what I get. (linked to Imgur)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I tried my other 2 mobile hotspots, then there are no interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

Some time ago a resolution showed up in my display manager, and nvidia cp of 4096x2160. Which from what I understand my TV does not support.

Now the issue comes in when I try to install any new game. Nearly all of them tries to default to this resolution (4096x2160). Which in turn has the tv spit back no signal. So I need to alt+enter, alt+f4, ect.. to get out of the game. Google the game, find were the settings file is and manually set windowed, or the resolution I desire just so I can get into the application.

I've tried googling it a few times with no luck. Any support would be appreciated.

,techsupport,"I've been having this issue for several months now and I've searched everywhere to find a solution to this problem but I can't find anything.

PC Specs:

GTX 780Ti (stock), Intel i7 5820k, AS Rock X99 Extreme4,  8Gb RAM, Silicon Power 256Gb SSD, 3TB Seagate HDD, Smart 750W 80Plus bronze Thermaltake PSU, Windows 10 64-bit OS.

&amp;#x200B;

First I'd like to say that I've had this PC for 7 years now and the only thing I've upgraded since then was my storage which I did over a year ago. At first I thought it was a simple dust build-up in the GPU fan so I cleaned it and it did not solve the issue. I proceeded to take every part out, clean the entire PC, re-applied the thermal paste on both my CPU and my GPU and this still did not solve the issue, I've tried stress tests (OCCT) and I left it running for 4 hours and it did not crash or say anything wrong with my PC, I also used Furmark and there still was no issue. I'll list the games I play detailing problems if they exist:

Phantasy Star Online 2 (During certain quests it MAY crash, not 100% of the time)

Fortnite (Crashes within an hour of playing)

Yuzu emulator Smash Brothers Ultimate (Crashes within 2-3 hours of playing)

League of Legends (Does not crash)

Brawlhalla (Does not crash)

Among us (Does not crash)

GTA V (Does not crash)

Rocket League (Crashes within 20 minutes)

&amp;#x200B;

These are all the games that I've played in recent time and had issues with it crashing, at first I thought it was an issue with games being too demanding and my GPU started to give out but Furmark stressed my GPU more than any of these games ever could, Rocket League is a particularly strange one to me since I don't believe it's more demanding than Fortnite or GTA V.

I know that this website is not accurate but I have some friends that have  50$ hyperx and corsair keyboards with 125Hz polling rate and they got 8-10 ms (they are not releasing the key faster than me. I tried this for 2 hours, believe me I mastered the technique ,16-17 is the lowest I got and my friends are not even trying that hard). Unlike other similar products there’s no way to check or set a polling rate in the durgod zeus engine. So why are they getting better results than me even though my polling rate is higher. 

results here [https://imgur.com/a/4OeldUl](https://imgur.com/a/4OeldUl)

Someone suggested to check the binterval (the ms between each check) so I installed the USB device tree viewer and saw that the  binterval is actually 1ms [https://imgur.com/a/6j9tC8N](https://imgur.com/a/6j9tC8N) . So It's not an issue with my keyboard......... And then I discovered the real problem the connection speed of all my devices is set to Fullspeed (USB 1.1) [https://imgur.com/a/BdXHMEq](https://imgur.com/a/BdXHMEq) even though my mouse , keyboard are plugged in a  USB 3.0 port(it is blue), it should instead say Superspeed. I noticed that the ports that my devices are connected to don't have that 'S' that indicates superspeed (supported protocols 3.0) and instead they are connected to ""H"" ports that say supported protocols (1.1, 2.0) . Even then , my devices are connected to ""H"" ports (supported protocols 1.1,   2.0) but the speed is still Fullspeed(USB 1,1) shouldn't it say Highspeed (USB 2.0) [https://imgur.com/a/Dh9O6ml](https://imgur.com/a/Dh9O6ml)

Is something limiting my speed? why is it USB 1.1 speeds even though my USB 2.0 is supported(H ports) and why are my USB 3.0 devices in ""H"" ports and not ""S""? Is there like a bios setting or something?

I know that this website is not accurate but I have some friends that have  50$ hyperx and corsair keyboards with 125Hz polling rate and they got 8-10 ms (they are not releasing the key faster than me. I tried this for 2 hours, believe me I mastered the technique ,16-17 is the lowest I got and my friends are not even trying that hard). Unlike other similar products there’s no way to check or set a polling rate in the durgod zeus engine. So why are they getting better results than me even though my polling rate is higher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;results here &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/4OeldUl""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/4OeldUl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone suggested to check the binterval (the ms between each check) so I installed the USB device tree viewer and saw that the  binterval is actually 1ms &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/6j9tC8N""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/6j9tC8N&lt;/a&gt; . So It&amp;#39;s not an issue with my keyboard.........

,techsupport,"Hi! So first, thank you to anyone who takes the time to read and help, I really appreciate that this sub exists and the people who take the time to help others.

I just moved into a house apartment where the internet cost is included in rent. But what I wasn't told is that it's actually set up next door (the landlord owns both properties) and we share with them. We were having major problems with lag and dropping connection to the point it was unusable so the landlord was able to upgrade to 100mbps which improved quite a lot on my laptop.

But I'm still getting connection dropping, and any devices that are further from the Wifi next door just don't work (even across the room...). I have a Chromecast and haven't been able to use it as the connection drops out constantly and sometimes just won't connect.

I looked into repeaters or extenders but then I've read that slows down speed a lot and may not even work. Then I saw a suggestion to use a Wifi hotspot. So I set that up on my laptop. If I connect our other devices to that network, are there any likely issues? I tested it with my phone and it seems to be working well.

I don't want to do anything that creates major lag for the other tenants though, especially if there is a better solution. I also saw options for (I think) bridging and setting up our own router, but that seems beyond my ability...

,techsupport,"I actually have two problems and I'm not sure if they're linked or not.

Firstly, sometimes my PC doesn't boot and I get a one beep code (Dell support says: ""Possible motherboard failure - BIOS ROM checksum failure"").  However, whenever I turn it off and start it up again it always works.

&amp;#x200B;

The other problem is that sometimes my PC just totally freezes the screen whilst I've been using it and nothing works, no BSOD or anything.  I restart it and it's fine.  

I've looked at Event Logs and it doesn't show anything apart from the fact that the system was shutdown incorrectly (have to hold the power/reset button until it turns off). 

It seems to do it at random times under not much stress and it can go hours and hours or even days without doing it.

I recorded the times it's happened in the past week and couldn't notice any pattern or software that might be the cause:

\- Sunday 22nd @ 15:10

Screen froze whilst typing into a notepad document.   Lightroom open in background.  

\- Monday 23rd @ 17:05

Screen froze whilst loading a photo preview in Lightroom.    Word document and folder opened in the background.  

\- Sunday 29th @ 15:30

Screen froze with Firefox open, but I was away from my computer at the time.  Had some tabs open, but no videos or anything were playing, just things like FB, whatsapp, Reddit.    Had a folder open in the background.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've been using my computer pretty much constantly the past week and for way more intensive things a lot of the time, but it's only happened on these three occasions.

It's actually been happening for years, I've reinstalled Windows a number of times and it's also been happening both before and after I installed a new PSU &amp; SSD/HDD.

It's an old Dell XPS8100 running Windows 7 with 8GB RAM, i7 860 CPU, Corsair CX 500 PSU (upgraded from a Dell Liteon 350W Power Supply) with an SSD and HDD.

&lt;p&gt;Last time It happened i Just held the Power button for a little longer so It could pass by the First boot phase but its not working now; This time when i hold It for a longer time It happens the same as If i simply click It but the difference is that If i hold It the pc Just try to boot a single time and then sleeps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: my bad If the title sound a little Dumb, It is connected to power&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit2: SOLVED! I opened It and pressed the cables a little and its on!&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I didnt manage to get installed. Basically my bios detects all my disks ubuntu too , hardware is fine i think.

&amp;#x200B;

**before each time i try to installed i did go to ubuntu live usb and from gparted i remove every partition i create new gpt type and i try with every format, fat32, ntfs, ext4, witouth anyone just with gpt.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Nothing worked, same error.**

&amp;#x200B;

**I also tried to install in another disk, one 1TB SSD i have and didnt worked either**

&amp;#x200B;

Before installing i go to other computer, and with rufus/windows media creation tool( i install in a 32GB USB windows.iso) , tried with both, that is not the problem, iso downloaded with media creation tool.

Everything fine, i boot in uefi + legacy mode (both, i have asus prime x470 pro, this csm mode is by default)

&amp;#x200B;

when im already in windnows installation , when i need to choose a disk, i choose my nvme  , click next and it says :

""cant create a partition or find a existing one""

&amp;#x200B;

sometimes it goes to ""copying windows file"" step, but after 5 seconds it says that instalation cant go and i need to rebot installation.

When I turn on the monitor at the same time as the pc itself, it works flawlessly.

However, I sometimes leave the pc on overnight. Or when I am cooking, and subsequently eating dinner. 

I tend to turn off the monitor when  this happens. As I did with my old one.

My current monitor is a MSI mag241c, 144hz 1ms. I’m currently using it only for gaming especially with fast pace games which require a lot of flicking.

I’ve read this kind of monitors are not the best for gaming because the pixel are slower to change colors and this cause a sort of “motion blur” effect in games with a lot of camera movements. 
This is what happened to me, I’m basically blind half of the times.

I want to know if someone was in my same situation and if a TN panel suits better for my usage or the differences are not so noticeable between the two technologies.",t2_1evr4stb,False,,0,False,TN panel vs VN panel,[],r/techsupport,,False,6,open-hardware,0,,,False,t3_k3a4mq,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Open | Hardware,False,1,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1606688457.0,text,6,,,text,self.techsupport,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys, &lt;/p&gt;

In short what happened was the small springs in the stock cooler had to be pushed in with some amount of pressure to work. Because I was building on the motherboard box the motherboard was bending to much making it really hard to do so. So while aligning the screw of the cooler with the socket as my cooler was attached to the cpu with thermal paste it pulled the CPU out. Thus bending a pin. I fixed that pin back in and then screwed it on the bare floor. Where there was no static electricity. And then everything went just fine.

I have 3 intake fans on the front and one fan blowing out air in the back.

When I finished building it I turned it on, and everything seemed to work alright, until I played a match of League of Legends and my pc restarted itself, I tried to recconect to the match, and it restarted again.
Basically it only restarts when I play a game of LoL, I tried playing other games like WoW, Warzone and Bioshock 2 remastered, and everything goes smoothly.

I tried a lot of things and it keeps happening for example:
- I reinstalled windows.

So I recently bought a new PC, and from the very first windows installation I have experienced constant BSOD's. The first time I took the PC back and they had switched out the RAM, this however did not stop the BSOD's. Second time I took it back, they updated the realtek audio drivers, from what I could tell, and that seemed to stop the BSOD's for about a day. However since yesterday night the BSOD's are back. They seem to happen whenever e.g gaming, browsing internet or just PC being idle.  


BlueScreenView and Whocrashed both show different error codes and suspected drivers each time  


the system is win 10 64bit  
16gb ram  
b450 gigabyte gaming MB  
1660 gtx

Can anyone please help me identify what the issue could be before I return this back and try to get my money back for good.

Today I could not boot again(fans spinning at 100%, etc). So i replaced my RAM with the other computer RAM. The spinning thing did not happen, but I cannot get into BIOS as there is no display.

Then i tried to put my GPU and my RAM in the other computer and they work fine.


Does this mean my motherboard is dead? I really need to narrow the issue because i work+study and cannot order things and return them constantly.

Thank you j advance!

Hoping to get some help with solving this problem with my Sony Bravia from 2011.

Before I get into it, here's a photo of the screen for some context, as well as a shot of the T-Con board.

It seems as though the vertical lines have been appearing progressively over time, but recently they've gotten to this point. The problem isn't as prevalent in the first 10 seconds of starting up, but as it warms up the lines become even more blown out. The degree of the problem also depends on the image/colour. 

Anyone have any idea what could be the problem? Is it a problem with the screen or rather the T-Con board?

This has been going on for a while. Generally, it has to connect to the wifi and then it works for a while, for streaming videos and such, but then when actively browsing, the connection gets lost.  
What we already tried was to update the drivers for the network controller, or roll back an update, reinstall the drivers. All of that.  
As it is currently, in order for it to work, I have to go to the Network controller properties, select ""update driver"" and then it works for a while.  
Under the events it lists:

Also, there was the suspicion that it is due to the power saving settings in the device, however, there is no power management tab to be found here.

I have read about the power and cooling improvements available with an undervolt so used this guide to undervolt. https://sff.life/how-to-undervolt-gpu/

The documented card factory settings are high anyway with a base clock of 1607 and a boost of 1721.

Untouched (I have not overclocked it) the card was nevertheless boosting up to 1949, drawing 1.050 core voltage.

Following the guide I set figures down in steps to 1800 max and 0.875 core voltage.
However, after running timespy two dozen times HWiNFO64 and GPU-Z are still reporting the higher figures. I.e. the afterburner setting are not having any effect on the card performance. It is still drawing 1.050 and still boosting to 1949.

Motherboard is a Gigabyte Z370N wifi Mini ITX board. Not sure if there are setting on that which I need to adjust to make this work?

Grateful for any tips or pointers please. I don’t get it that Afterburner will have an effect if I set it to limit temperature but not for the undervolt settings.

‘Unlock voltage control’ is checked and set to reference design which this card is.
‘Enable low-level IO driver’ is checked.

&lt;li&gt;************** JIT Debugging ************** &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To enable just-in-time (JIT) debugging, the .config file for this &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;application or computer (machine.config) must have the &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jitDebugging value set in the system.windows.forms section. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The application must also be compiled with debugging &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enabled. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;   &amp;lt;system.windows.forms jitDebugging=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When JIT debugging is enabled, any unhandled exception &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;will be sent to the JIT debugger registered on the computer &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rather than be handled by this dialog box.&lt;/li&gt;

ASRock Z390 Phantom Gaming 4S

600 Watt Power Supply

16 GB DDR4-3000

GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER (msi Twin Frozr 7)

The problems started about a week in, newer games (I believe all of which are DirectX 12) began freezing and req. End Task seconds in to starting the actual game (menus worked fine). Let me specify, this was happening exactly the same for every game that is DirectX 12 only.

I rolled the drivers back and it seemed to work again for a day without that issue.

Then it started worse. I hadn't updated the driver, or anything else for that matter, and the crashes became more pronounced. Instead of a freeze it was a crash to desktop, some games (such as AC Valhalla) would start for a second or two with weird shader artifacts.

After rolling drivers around to try different versions, the problem persisted and I decided to format my new install in case something went awry with Windows.

Fresh install of Windows, Games, Direct X, Drivers etc. and that same exact problem persists.

I checked a hardware monitor back when the initial freezes started (checked again, even though no game could even approach putting a load on anything with how quickly they crash, if they even get to the point of drawing anything outside of a menu) and the temps all read fine except for a possibilty faulty sensor on the motherboard. (It reads over 100 celsius, idle, for CPU 4, but the temp sensor for the processor reads normal).

The only thing (I have tried many games) that uses DirectX 12 that works is 3D Mark stress test and benchmark. Other than that, no game will load and run past the menu and maybe a weird shader mess for a couple seconds.

I really don't want to go through the hassle of returning anything if I am missing something, but at this point I am running out of options for getting this build to work.

I have tried many different versions of the nVidia drivers, fresh install of everything including OS. 

Leaning towards this being something wrong with the video card just because everything else seems to be working fine and the fact that the current state of my PC is now exactly the same as it was when it was initially working, as if something is degrading due to load.

But if anyone has any suggestions or opinions I would love to hear them.

Thanks.

,techsupport,"Hi folks,

Yesterday I finally got to build my first PC and it’s running super well. The GPU is a temporary solution but it runs great. However, with an uncapped framerate I tend to get a lot of tearing on my TV display (will switch to monitor in a month) - if I then enable Vsync, games such as Horizon Zero Dawn lock to 30 instead of a smooth 60 that is easily attainable with the settings I use. Without the cap, it’s in the high 70s.

My specs are:
- Ryzen 5 5600X
- MSI B550 A-Pro
- 32GB 3200 CL16 RAM
- M.2 Samsung 970 Evo SSD 1TB
- Radeon RX 580

The screen is a 2018 LG 4K TV, unsure about the specific model but it can do 4K 60 over HDMI no problem on a One X.

,techsupport,"So I recently built a new gaming PC around late September 2020, and it has been working fine except for one issue: it keeps disconnecting from my Wi-Fi. It's connected through a Wi-Fi dongle, because my PC is upstairs in my room and there's no way I can route an ethernet cable from the router on the first floor to the second floor where my PC is. I have noticed that every time I do an online activity that consumes a lot of data (i.e. downloading, watching videos, etc.) it just keeps randomly disconnecting. All other devices in my household do not experience this problem, just my PC alone. It's getting on my nerves to turn off wireless connection from the taskbar then turning it on again just to reconnect.

For the record, I have already tried to update the driver using device manager, but it just says that the best drivers are already installed. I also tried to look for the latest drivers for the specific dongle (Realtek 802.11n) and manually installing it, but the problem still persists.

,techsupport,"I'm on mobile, so I apologize for any formatting issues. Also I was unsure about the flair, so I'm sorry if it's incorrect.

It's not a new sd card, about three years old, I think? It corrupted or something basically overnight, I woke up and picked up my phone to see a notif saying it wasnt recognizing the sd card and wanting me to format it. I took it out to see if I could save the data before formatting, which I did, none of the data seemed corrupted or wrong in any way.

However when I tried to format it through the file explorer, it keeps giving an error message, basically just ""cannot format"" with no error codes or anything. I googled it, and tried formatting it through Windows Disk Manager, which also failed. I downloaded a couple programs online to see if it worked, one was just called ""sd card formatter"" and failed, and easeus had the function behind a paywall, so that wasn't doable.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a new sd card, about three years old, I think? It corrupted or something basically overnight, I woke up and picked up my phone to see a notif saying it wasnt recognizing the sd card and wanting me to format it. I took it out to see if I could save the data before formatting, which I did, none of the data seemed corrupted or wrong in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However when I tried to format it through the file explorer, it keeps giving an error message, basically just &amp;quot;cannot format&amp;quot; with no error codes or anything. I googled it, and tried formatting it through Windows Disk Manager, which also failed. I downloaded a couple programs online to see if it worked, one was just called &amp;quot;sd card formatter&amp;quot; and failed, and easeus had the function behind a paywall, so that wasn&amp;#39;t doable. I also tried going through diskpart, but it also failed.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, I had no issues getting the build to Post, and went into BIOS, selected the SK Hynix SSD for my Windows 10 Pro install with no issues. Later, while installing some stuff I noticed the SK Hynix didn't even show up as a hard drive to install to. Upon further investigation I realized my PC didn't see the SK SSD at all. I went back into the BIOS and ran a Quick DTS self test on the SK SSD, which it failed. The Sabrent Rocket passed just fine. I figure my SSD is bad so I'll have to just swap windows over the the rocket while I get a refund on the SK Hynix. When trying to select the other SSD to install windows, I get a warning stating windows files have already been found and they will be set aside in a Windows.Old folder, and not be able to be used. ""uhhh.... Ok"", but the PC simply won't let me continue no matter how much I try to continue with the install. A friend tells me to take the faulty SK Hynix SSD out and re-upload my windows 10 fresh from my flash drive to the Rocket. Oki-dokie. Nope. Now BIOS won't recognize/can't see the Rocket SSD. I have NO choices to choose from to install the OS to. When I re-install the SK Hynix SSD, I can see it and the Rocket again. 

I am baffled. I have never run into this before. I'm currently using the 1TB SK Hynix SSD that my computer cannot even see to use, let alone install anything to, and I cannot seem to install windows to anything else to replace it.

,techsupport,"Around 6 years ago I was using a tiny little Acer notebook. Pretty low end, about $350. Within a year (as soon as the warranty ran out) it started having an issue with the hard disk and refused to boot up. Or rather, with multiple attempts, I could sometimes get it to boot up (I was luckily able to get all of my data off of this laptop before it became nearly impossible to boot.)

Since that laptop died, I've gone through a couple better laptops, and have been using a fairly powerful one for a couple years now. Its specs are as follows:

* 2.5 GHz quad-core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, Windows 10, dedicated graphics card

Despite a handful of slowdown issues (I'll touch on these in a moment) I would say it works decently well. However, while going through my old stuff, I decided to try booting up my old Acer netbook just to see if I could get it to boot at all. Not only did it boot up, but I was able to play around with it without an inkling of slowdown. Seeing it function so smoothly made me realize that the laptop I've been using doesn't perform anywhere near as well. And to clarify, these are the stats of said notebook:

* 1.5 GHz dual-core processor, 4GB RAM, Windows 7, integrated graphics card.

It doesn't make sense at all why this would perform so much better, but to be fair, it does appear that there are certain triggers for what my current laptop does poorly.

* dwm.exe - Interacting with the taskbar, opening up the start menu, interacting with Windows Explorer, or searching something in the start menu all have significant startup lag. Once these things are loaded into memory (not sure if it's loaded to RAM, cache, or both) they work just fine; in other words, once I've searched on term in the start menu, I can search others easily (until I stop using the search feature long enough for it to be purged from volatile memory.)
* Switching between processes -  Same issue as above. Reloading a page in Chrome after neglecting it for a while, or switching between Chrome, Unity, and Visual Studio, has a horrendous startup lag (to be fair, each of these processes is fairly heavyweight.) Windows Media Player seems to work just fine without this issue, likely due to its lower resource cost.
* Bottleneck upon startup or rousing from sleep - Again, this seems like a volatile memory issue to me. Once I interact with any of the processes that are jammed up, they eventually start to pick up and work just fine.

Investigating any of these slowdowns in Task Manager will yield a high System utilization of disk drives. I'm not exactly sure what's happening here, my guess is that at some point when RAM or cache memory are needed for the processes I'm using, volatile memory related to the processes I'm neglecting are being written to disk, and when I switch back to that process, they're being loaded from disk. Otherwise I have no idea why there would be such heavy load for something like this.

I also have a suspicion that Windows 10 (or perhaps something more low-level specific to my system) assumes users will not switch between processes (or use the taskbar) frequently and thus don't keep processes such as dwm.exe in active memory, whereas on my ""shitty"" netbook, the taskbar is always ready to go at a moment's notice. It almost feels like some kind of optimization to maximize the amount of RAM/cache available for a single process, only in my case it seems like all it does is slow things down.

I've scoured the interwebs and the picture is still not so clear.

Basically, I bought this internal SSD off a Black Friday whim for my rMBP that's ran out of usable space a long time ago. As you can see, it's a *Samsung 860 EVO 500 GB SATA 2.5 Inch Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) (MZ-76E500)*

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know that my current SSD (120GB) is a Samsung (I remember seeing it when I replaced the battery), so that's what APPLE SSD SM128E means (mentioned in the System Report).  
All the YouTube videos I see online upgrading this rMBP's SSD with a Samsung EVO SSD have the replacement SSD in a ""card"" format. There's talk of mSATA, M.2, and that people buy adaptors/connectors to fit those cards in; but there are no tutorials for this 2.5"" internal SSD form (even though there seems to be ample space inside the machine to fit one).  
Some tutorials (referring to the mid 2012 model) do manage it, and it seems to be a pretty straightforward swap; but apparently this rMBP is a mixed breed in terms of using some kind of Apple proprietary connector format? Something like that? Am I understanding things right?

,techsupport,"Hi, I really, really can't figure out what the issue is here.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Context:

I have been using a $10 Bluetooth 4.0 usb audio adapter for quite some time now for things like controllers, keyboards, mice, etc.

I'm currently trying to use the JBL LIVE 300 TWS earbuds, brand new.

Windows 10 Enterprise

Version 2004

OS build 19041.630

\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Problem:

Bluetooth earbuds/headphones have an issue where the audio will **stutter constantly**. **It stutters every single second**. Not every 5-10 seconds, and not just audio lag.  The audio will cut in and out, in and out, in and out.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Attempted Solutions:

1. Unpaired and re-paired the device
2. Updated all drivers (All up-to-date)
3. Disconnected all other bluetooth devices
4. Ran audio troubleshooter (No issue detected)
5. Ran bluetooth troubleshooter (No issue detected)
6. Disabled Audio Enhancements (Tab does not appear in device properties)
7. Changed Audio Format (Options are greyed out)
8. Updated Windows
9. Disabled Hands-free Telephony
10. Disabled all bluetooth features except Audio Sink
11. Update drivers &gt; Search my computer &gt; Select from a list &gt; uncheck ""Show compatible hardware"" &gt; Microsoft + Handsfree Audio Gateway Service
12. Same as number 4, but with Headset Audio Gateway Service
13. Disabled Microsoft Bluetooth LE Enumerator in Device Manager

\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Things to note:

* The device works fine with my iPhone.
* Trying a second bluetooth audio device has the same issue.
* I read that 2.4GHz wifi might be an issue.
   * I live in an apartment building.
   * All of my devices are connected to my 2.4GHz wifi, not my 5GHz.
      * iPhone, iPad (off), Macbook Pro (off), Flex streaming box (off), Apple TV (off), Nintendo Switch (off), iRobot vaccuum (off)

Hi, I told my friend to get Clownfish Voice Changer and after he uninstalled it (didn't like it) it pretty much broke his input and output on his computer.

The Realtek device wouldn't appear in the device manager, so he installed new Realtek drivers. Then, everything worked except the Realtek Audio Console program which he wanted, so we tried a LOT more stuff (which I can try to explain if necessary but it mostly consisted of installing older Realtek drivers, doing a windows update, uninstalling Realtek drivers, and restarting). Sometimes this would fix issues, but there was always at least one problem with the input, output, or program.

Currently, he has the drivers uninstalled and his speakers work, but the mic on his headset doesn't.

Does anyone know what Clownfish might have done to the drivers or how to reinstall them correctly? I think we may have done it wrong, all we did was download the drivers from the website here: [https://realtek-download.com/download-hd/](https://realtek-download.com/download-hd/)

,techsupport,"Hi all, firstly please excuse my lack of tech knowledge!

I just upgraded my brand new laptop (MSI GF75 10SDR) with extra RAM and added 1TB SSD in the empty SATA slot. The stock storage is 512GB SSD (M.2 slot).

Prior to the upgrade, I had read a lot of stuff about setting the boot options in the BIOS, partitions and putting/cloning the OS onto the SSD for much faster boot time and loading programs/games, versus on the internal HDD. (I'm still trying to understand all that)  
I actually didn't realise the stock storage is already an SSD and not a HDD, and realised that the stuff I read didn't really apply to me. 

My questions are:

*  Is there a need to move the OS onto the new 1TB SSD?
* Any recommendations on what (programs/fiiles) should go on which SSD, or does it matter?
* Can I do this: Keep OS and main documents (C:\\Users\\User\\) in the internal SSD, and install games and frequently used programs (Chrome, Adobe CC) onto the 1TB SSD?

Hello, i just bought an Asus TUF Gaming VG249Q Monitor for my gaming laptop and it came with a DisplayPort cable. I've been reading about it and turns out regular HDMI cables cannot display at 144hz which is the only reason why I bought the monitor in the first place.

My laptop does not have a plug for DisplayPort only for regular HDMI cables. I was wondering if an HDMI 2.1 cable would give me the 144hz refresh rate or if there is an adapter I could buy to plug in the displayport cable into the HDMI port in my laptop.

As it stands the refresh rate of the monitor is the same as the 75hz from the laptop and I'm not getting any use out of the 200$monitor.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I do have CentOS 7.5 Minimal that I have valuable information and data on and I need to have a backup. But I'm having many difficulties and strange things happened when I tried to create the backup. I'll try to keep issues in a small manageable size, thus I'm asking a part of questions in a time:

This is how my Root drive looks like and I believe I only have about 2'586.7M of data and the size of the SSD in my VPS is about 10.7GB I believe as below:

[https://prnt.sc/vs47zs](https://prnt.sc/vs47zs)

&amp;#x200B;

I ran a backup command to backup and compress everything in a 'Tar.gz' file as

    &gt;tar -zcvpf /backup/full-backup-`date '+%d-%B-%Y'`.tar.gz --directory / --exclude=mnt --exclude=proc --exclude=tmp --exclude=backup

But output was a 5.76GB file in '.Tar.gz' format that doesn't make sense at all. And the file was stopped creation as well, on the command line in the Console, I encountered this screen after about a month time that I let this file be created,

 [https://prnt.sc/vs4amc](https://prnt.sc/vs4amc)

Then I Ctrl+Alt+Del the VPS from Console and it changed to this for a second before it restarts,

[https://prnt.sc/vs4b1j](https://prnt.sc/vs4b1j)

&amp;#x200B;

Output was the 5.76GB file in full-backup-tar.gz without any date in the file name as it encountered short space in the drive. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is how my drives in VPS looks like as well:

[https://prnt.sc/vs4c23](https://prnt.sc/vs4c23)

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything wrong with my backup command that this happened and how shall I fix this backup issue?

I want an intact ***bare-metal backup in a compressed format*** that in case I moved my VPS provider, I can change the IP and then my VPS backup shall work in all the bare-metal KVM VPS providers. May please help me achieve this and please do ask about screenshots if required to give technical data for the answer and I'll happily reply.

in 2020 I got my first 144hz monitor, and I've been using it ever since, and I have slowly been having more and more problems using my computer in graphic intensive games and software

THIS ISSUE IS RESOLVED BUT IM TELLING IT JUST IN CASE

my graphics card would shut itself off and turn back on whenever i reached the 80 degree celsius mark for more than 30 minutes at a time, running full blast fans and getting super hot

i resolved this by undervolting and underclocking my graphics card, and since my old case was shitty, i have since then updated to a ryzen 3 3100, a320m motherboard, and a good case with tons of airflow

since early 2020, I have been having this problem that is somewhat similar to the crashing ingame

while rendering any super intensive part of a video i am editing in after effects, my monitor will freeze, sound will turn off, monitor turns off, then turns back on after about 7 seconds and sound comes back

sometimes my monitor and sound never turn back on and instead my whole entire pc restarts

i am then told in my AMD Radeon Settings that the default Wattman settings were restored due to an unexpected software crash

&amp;#x200B;

SINCE ALL OF THIS I HAVE TRIED:

* reinstalling after effects (still crashes on non-pirated after effects too so its not because of pirated software)
* resetting my pc (works, but came back after a week or so)
* reinstalling/uninstalling intensive effects on videos
* undervolted, underclocked gpu
* overvolted, overclocked gpu
* display driver uninstaller, reinstalled drivers
* manually reinstalled drivers
* rollback drivers
* adjusted TONS of different settings in radeon settings

&amp;#x200B;

so what i am asking for is this:

* is there anything I can do to use after effects without having my graphics card crash?
* should i switch to nvidia?
* is my graphics card the problem because it is second hand?\\

today i will try the following:

* try to edit with connecting my monitor to the motherboard instead of the gpu, so i dont have to use my gpu while editing
* try editing on 60hz display settings instead of 144hz

On the one hand I heard you can have your hard drive wiped on pretty much any device, BUT I also heard that this doesn’t permanently delete the data and there is still a way to retrieve data from a wiped hard drive. (Even if you take it to a professional. Which btw what places even do that??)

If that’s true than that means the only way to truly get rid of everything on a hard drive is to destroy it. BUT
-what about iPads? (iPad 1/2, iPad Air 2, iPad 5th generation) they say you cannot remove or replace a hard drive. (Also bonus is there a way to even see what’s on the hard drive despite not being able to take it out?) also what happens when you recycle it? Do you request to be given the hard drive?
-what if you have a really old laptop (2010/2012) acer. How much do you think it would be to replace? WHERE could you even go to pay someone to do so?
- Mac book pro. All I see is how apple wont work on older devices.

Sorry if it seems like I’m paranoid but I thought I had everything figured “I’ll just go and pay like 50-100 bucks per device to have them wiped and then it’s unretrievable and gone” but as I’m doing more research I hear “even if a hardware is wiped the data can still be retrieved/ doesn’t go away unless you destroy it”

I'm moving into a RV full time, and I'm taking my gaming PC with me. I've got a 2080 TI graphics card which is pretty big. I just realized that whenever we move, it's going to be bouncing around quite a bit on the road.

My concern is that this may stress the port it's connected to on the motherboard. Is this a valid concern? I thought I could probably just ball up a t-shirt or something and put it underneath the card whenever we're moving to give it some support.

I just don't want it to bounce up and down and like snap off the connectors or break the port on the motherboard. I have no idea how sturdy they are or if I'm at risk for damaging anything. The only other option I see is removing it every time we move, but that seems like it may be worse for the port over time.

Hello,

I built my friend's computer quite a while back but the past 6 months his computer has been running into an issue. His computer is freezing or locking up constantly. When playing Overwatch or even watching youtube videos his computer will freeze for a couple of seconds, while the sound is still running normally in the background, and then unfreeze and go back to normal. This happens when playing any game with or without an internet connection. Obviously, this is very frustrating and we have tried near EVERYTHING to fix it and have just not been able to get it to stop.

,techsupport,"Hey guys, you are my last hope

Recently I updated my GPU and since then I started to notice some very weird flickering/lag/stutter which happens in multiple situations but it's most notable when scrolling through apps. Please check the link below to understand what I mean:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTpP6OlGD3A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab\_channel=Cassar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTpP6OlGD3A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=Cassar)

The issue also happens in other web browsers such as Chrome and even Edge. The issue is more notable when there are images/GIFs moving around while I'm scrolling. I was able to record the issue using Action, I'm assuming that if I was able to record it then it means it can't be a problem with the monitors or with the cables, right?

Now I am going to list the things I have tried in order to help you narrow down what the problem could be.

I have already tried reversing back to my old GPU (I didn't change any drivers, I only changed the card itself) and the issue persisted, which makes me think that the fact that this started after I upgraded my GPU might be a coincidence. The other hardware related fixes that I have attempted were: I have tried turning the computer on with only one monitor (I have a triple monitor setting usually) and I have tried multiple cables (4 different displayport 1.2) and an HDMI cable. I'm not sure if my displayport cables have shielding against interference, so that could be the issue I suppose.

Now to the things that I have tried when it comes to software: I have tried turning freesync on, turned on hardware acceleration for windows, turning on/off smooth scrolling. I have tried changing the frequency of the monitors (59.940Hz, 59.997Hz, 60.000Hz, 64.006Hz). I have even gone as far as reverting to an old version of Windows because I thought the issue could be related to the recent updates. Nothing.

The interesting thing in all of this is that it only seems to happen in certain scenarios. My monitors are 4k60Hz, and I often open an youtube video on that quality just to test and I see that the video is silky smooth, this problem does not happen at all. This issue also does not happen while I'm gaming, even at 4k with every setting on Ultra. I get no frame drops and no weird flickering. It does happen with some games but I can chalk that off as being the game's fault.

I'm completely lost as to what this could be and I really hope you guys can help me out. Thank you so much in advance for taking your time to read this.

,techsupport,"In these weeks i'm searching about this topic, because i use a PS3 controller in pc since 6 years, (and 10 in his normal use, in a PS3 Console), so the battery is getting old and when I pressed two buttons in the same time, another button is pressed. 
For example I press D-Pad right and X button and the Triangle button is pressed because yes. So this is funny to see in games like GTA V, trying again the mission in online because that. Fortunately I have another PS3 controller more new that the came with the console 10 years ago. But I thinking in changed it and let it sleep eternally.

So my choices are the Xbox Series Controller, specially the Blue color because I looks sexy, the PS5 Dualsense Controller and the Switch Pro Controller.

Why this controllers? Well:

The Xbox Series Controller because:
• is Windows Friendly, that means i don't bother for the drivers don't work, or i don't have vibration because the drivers, or my controller freaks out while i charging, etc. Is for Windows 10
• I heard the shape improves since the Xbox One Controller, the grip and feel is good with the new texture, and back to 2009 when i feel the Xbox 360 controller, I wanted a Xbox controller because is more comfortable than the PlayStation controller.
• For me looks so beautiful, comparing it with the others i've mentioned in here
• Is not problem for me, but looking the right buttons in the games according the controller, see Y in the game and controller. Not Triangle only in the controller.
• The d-pad looks great i think for tetris and old games/plataformers i want to play.

The PS5 Dualsense because:
• Too much content creators says this controller is so comfortable and so grippy
• The adaptive triggers buys me, looks so attractive and it is implemented so great in shooters (i don't play shooters with controller but only for this technology wants me to play it that way), but I don't know if sony or a third-party driver enable this for PC and the developers want to implement this on the newer and existing PC Games, And I'm doubting because i see on several pages the PS4 Controller the touchpad and the speaker is not fully enhanced or supported in PC drivers, so that's the thing
• The black color looks so beautiful for me, i want it only in that color i don't like in white. Or something in blue, so i must to wait for that editions.
•The same for the rumble applies to the adaptive triggers, only hopes sony or a person and the developers adapt this to PC

The Switch Pro Controller:
• I have a Switch, so i use it in that and PC. Because the Joycons are not the best
• The buttons of the control looks so clicky and confortable and the Joystick is not getting drift like the joycons.
• My friends says the battery longs too much with life, more than the new generation of consoles i think
• The dpad its not great but is ok 
• The rumble i heard is great.

So this is my opinions about the controllers, i want a confortable control and i play adventure games, racing games, and sometimes tetris marathon. If i choose another controller and i want to use it on switch, can i buy the 8bitdo adapter, so i can't get stucked for the pro controller to my decision. What do you think?

• The rumble i heard is great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is my opinions about the controllers, i want a confortable control and i play adventure games, racing games, and sometimes tetris marathon. If i choose another controller and i want to use it on switch, can i buy the 8bitdo adapter, so i can&amp;#39;t get stucked for the pro controller to my decision. What do you think? Which controller I listed here is the best for PC? Thanks for see this post!&lt;/p&gt;

,techsupport,"Hey guys,

After a bit of help here if anyone can help!

A few weeks ago, I moved my PC from one room to another. Previously it was connected via ethernet and moved it into a room that didn't have an ethernet port set up.
Everything worked fine on WiFi until I set the ethernet port up and plugged the cable in.
I booted it up and it showed the BSoD with the error ""Stop Code: VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE ~ What failed: amdkmdag.sys""

After a bit of research it looked like there was a graphics driver update issue. The computer would still turn on every now and then, so I uninstalled drivers and reinstalled + updated to the latest using the manufacturers website. (AMD Radeon Software Adrenaline) 

Since then, the computer hasn't been able to boot up at all. It shows the error 
""stop code: 0xc00021a""
I can't boot the computer up into safe mode, it won't let me reset it, I've tried reseting bios and running the diagnostics tool but they all fail. The only thing I can get into is the command prompt.


I tried following the steps in this post here : https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3ttjp3/_/
But had no luck in completing the steps

Am I out of luck? It's a very old build but it ran the games I played and was a great work PC.

And just recently I decided I wanted to use it; however, when I plug in the power cord and turn it on absolutely nothing happens. I've tried different ac ports and different cables and had no success. I've also tried to turn it on with the controller and also nothing. Not sure if it means anything, but when I hook up the controller to the USB port I get a rumble (but it still doesn't turn on).  
This eventually led me to follow this video:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GagzJMcGcfc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GagzJMcGcfc)  


So I got out my multi meter and tested the power supply to see if it was broken/faulty. Upon testing this, the readings turned out to be correct across all pins (12v).  So I got down to the motherboard; to test for continuity, by checking the pins of the where the power supply socket goes in. Testing from top to bottom for each pin I get no beep. Testing it from the bottom;  from left to right, I get a beep. All this points towards the motherboard having no issues. So I went to test the mosfets by putting one multi meter pin to the Xbox One S gold pads to ground it, and another pin to the one of the mosfet pins, which returns no beep for all mosfets tested (mosfets don't appear to be the issue). The only thing I haven't tested is the RF board as I don't have a spare. I'm not sure how to test if it works without ordering a spare one.

I unplug all drives so all I have is the SSD, and the USB. Media creation boots, and I’m met with three problems. 1. I type in my product key and it isn’t valid, leading me to believe I must have jotted the key down wrong. I thought no big deal, I haven’t formatted my HHD so I can still get the key. I’ll just install windows without it and add the key later. 2. The SSD has a notification that windows cannot be installed onto it, and I don’t understand why. The drive is formatted correctly, plus I formatted the drive a second time inside the media creation tool, and it says it isn’t able to install. Again, I thought no big deal, I’ll boot up my old drive and just look things up and figure it out. 3. I cannot get my system to boot.

Honestly all I migrated from that drive was some steam games and adobe software. However, prior to doing all this, my computer only booted when I selected the SSD as the boot priority despite it not having windows installed on it. If I unplugged my HDD with windows on it, the SSD was not enough to boot alone, and if the SSD wasn’t in the HDD wasn’t enough to boot alone.

&lt;p&gt;Side note: I do have other computers in the house that I can use to plug the HDD or SSD into if need be. Can I retrieve the product key from my HDD if I plug it into another computer that is booting from a different drive?&lt;/p&gt;

since yesterday I have the problem that my hdd hard drive no longer works.

The first one was rather high and came three times, followed by a third sound that was rather deeper and so it was repeated. Today I bought a new hard drive and after a good two hours the problem came again. The PC has switched off and now the new HDD also makes sounds. A few days ago I improved my PC. I renewed the CPU, motherboard, and ram. Where could the problem be?

I've had this issue where I am completely unable to download this certain windows update (KB4586781), I'm not sure if it's important but the full name of the update is   


**2020-11 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 2004 for x64-based Systems (KB4586781)**

I've seen a few people saying that this update has had issues with installing, but I haven't seen anything past that. As soon as the update finishes downloading and reaches 100%, it says,

""Error encountered

some update files are missing or have problems. We'll try to download the update again later. Error code: (0x80070000d)""

&amp;#x200B;

and it gives me the option to retry the update, but every time I do, I get the same error message.

I have tried to manually download the update, but every time the installer finishes, I get the text,

&amp;#x200B;

""The following updates were not installed:

Security Update for Windows (KB4586781)""

&amp;#x200B;

Some people have told me to reinstall windows, which I have, and every time, on every fresh install, the same update fails every single time, no matter what I do it feels like.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of all of this, when I try and run the windows update troubleshooter I get an error that says that something prevented it from running, so I can't even use the built-in troubleshooter.

&amp;#x200B;

Something else that I have tried is several command prompt ""fixes"" according to some websites. After running the command 

**sfc /scannow**  several times, every time I get the same answer

&amp;#x200B;

""Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.

For online repairs, details are included in the CBS log file located at

windir\\Logs\\CBS\\CBS.log. For example C:\\Windows\\Logs\\CBS\\CBS.log. For offline

repairs, details are included in the log file provided by the /OFFLOGFILE flag.""

&amp;#x200B;

All of this would be fine, because I don't really NEED the update, but certain anticheats like easyanticheat which is used in games like rust and apex legends will not work without the most recent windows update.

&lt;p&gt;Something else that I have tried is several command prompt &amp;quot;fixes&amp;quot; according to some websites. After running the command &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sfc /scannow&lt;/strong&gt;  several times, every time I get the same answer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For online repairs, details are included in the CBS log file located at&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For offline&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;repairs, details are included in the log file provided by the /OFFLOGFILE flag.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this would be fine, because I don&amp;#39;t really NEED the update, but certain anticheats like easyanticheat which is used in games like rust and apex legends will not work without the most recent windows update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANY help is very much appreciated, thank you so much.&lt;/p&gt;

,techsupport,"Got a weird one for y'all, maybe.

My desktop PC (homebuilt) will occasionally, when clicking a link or opening a new tab in Firefox, do a hard reboot with an audible clicking sound. Total power off, then it'll bounce right back and power on after a few seconds.

At first I thought it was a CPU overheating issue, but temps aren't out of line and replacing the thermal paste didn't fix it.

I'm thinking it has something to do with the GPU, actually. Disabling hardware acceleration in the Firefox options seems to prevent this from happening, but it can go weeks at a time without the issue so this is another one of those hard to debug ones. This hasn't happened while gaming at all, I can run a benchmark without issue. The problem has only happened when using the browser that I've seen.

Any tips for things I can try to debug or prevent this? I'm running a 1080Ti, hoping to upgrade to a 3080 (whenever I end up actually getting my hands on it) with maybe a new mobo, and really praying that fixes it.

I’ve had this pc build for 1 month so far and have been dealing with following issues:

This happens mostly during Zoom meetings for some reason: My monitor just goes black and goes into power saving mode and I can see that my pc crashed as the RGB colors go instantly to default mode. In that scenario, I always have to restart my pc again.

2nd scenario: This happens mostly when I am not touching or moving the mouse cursor and just watch a stream etc. My screen just freezes and I cannot do again and just a moment after, I see that my pc RGB went into default mode again meaning it crashed. In that scenario, I also have to restart. 

For some reason, it never crashes during games but during these random moments when I don’t necessarily do much or just am on Zoom. 

My drivers are up to date so that’s out of the question.

Any ideas ?

Any idea how to make it all work cohesively?&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, first go to is there's something wrong with the GPU/thermals/etc. Could be, but I haven't been able to recreate the issue running GPU stress/stability tests. They all work fine with everything in normal temperature range. Also while in game, everything looks to be in normal range when it crashes, and looking at the .txt file of my GPU data, I don't see any abnormal spikes/drops leading up to the crash.

Rundown of everything I've done so far, in order, that hasn't worked.

1. Ran DDU uninstaller and removed the most recent driver (470.30 I  think), then reinstalled it.
2. Ran DDU uninstaller and removed the fresh install and installed the driver version before that.
3. Then ran DDU again and reinstalled the most recent driver as that didn't seem to be the issue.
4. Removed the GPU, took the back plate off to look for any obvious signs of damage/whatever
5. Ran the Heaven Benchmark 4.0, everything worked fine
6. Ran the Freestone Group GPU stability test, everything worked fine.
7. Ran the 3dmark timespy benchmark, no issue

Anyone have any other ideas as to what the issue could be? Unfortunately I don't have access to another PC/parts readily available, so I can't start swapping pieces out to verify if it is in fact the GPU causing the issue or not.

Downloaded BlueScreenViewer and was able to see my most recent crash was caused by watchdog.sys+3ad0. Poking around and seeing if I can find something related to that that might help, but nothing yet.

on the otherend with my consoles when I'm playing cod warzone my connection would be nearly unplayable with how much lag I'm getting from rubberbanding to just pure lag having people zip around   


the things I've tried so far to fix it is buying a new eithernet cable and then when that still didnt work i called my internet provider and upgraded my package but its still lagging its balls off   


my internet speeds are 889 down and 10 on the dot up. I've been told my isp might be throttling my internet and if that is the only thing anyone can think of is there a way i can fix this without having to buy a VPN service?

Outlook Notification Problem, suggestions?

Hey guys, so here’s a little problem that I can’t seem to solve. After the last update I installed, you know when you get an email on outlook and a pop-up notification shows up on the bottom right? And when you click that notification, it automatically opens up that email that you received. Well now whenever I click it, it does nothing, so I have to manually open my inbox and locate the email. 

The things I tried:

- starting outlook in safe mode and creating a new profile

- Uninstalling and reinstalling Microsoft office

- Disabling and re-enabling notifications on both windows and outlook

- Uninstalling the last update, and rebooting

Nothing seems to fix it. However I did notice that the last update has 2 updates that were installed, one of them that can be uninstalled, and the other cannot be uninstalled (assuming it’s essential). My thought is possibly the Ease tail update broke this feature.

&gt;Build lights up and fans spin but no POST or visual on monitor

System Configuration

**CPU**: ryzen 5950x

**GPU**: Asus strix gtx 1080ti

**MOBO**: Gigabyte x570-i aorus pro wifi

**PSU**: Corsair SF750

**RAM**: corsair vengeance LPX ddr4

**CPU Cooler**: nzxt kraken x53 AIO 280mm

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Power on

**Notes**:

[https://imgur.com/a/SAHR656](https://imgur.com/a/SAHR656)

I feel like I tried everything but no luck. Lights go on and I can hear the AIO but no POST (with speaker module connected to pins) and no image to monitor.

\- Used Q Flash utility to update to latest (f31j) BIOS. Renamed to GIGABYTE.bin as site described and appeared to work correctly. (light when on and flashed for a couple minutes then turned off)

\- Reseated CPU, GPU, RAM and all cables multiple times

\- validated the PSU,GPU, RAM, keyboard, hdmi cord and monitor all work on different machine.  
\- tried the CPU cooler connected directly to the CPU fan headers and also with a splitter to the AIO fans(this was the described method for this AIO)

&lt;p&gt;- validated the PSU,GPU, RAM, keyboard, hdmi cord and monitor all work on different machine.&lt;br/&gt;
- tried the CPU cooler connected directly to the CPU fan headers and also with a splitter to the AIO fans(this was the described method for this AIO)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated.....&lt;/p&gt;

I would like to have a work station with a USB-C monitor + wireless keyboard + wireless mouse.

What's the best way to set this up? I assume the keyboard and mouse cannot be bluetooth (because then I'd have to connect the devices to each laptop each time I want to use them), but would instead have to use wireless receivers to connect the devices to some sort of hub. Any tips?

,techsupport,"Hello! I just finished building my wife her first PC!  But we are experiencing some issues with the ethernet internet speeds. Let me explain the setup:

We use Verizon Fios 200 Mbps internet. Due to our residence, the Fios only has one connection, on the ground level.  Our office is upstairs on the second floor.  To use the internet up there I have been using the Netgear Powerline - Ethernet over power extender. This device has two plug in parts. The first goes down by the router, with one ethernet cable plugged into it and itself plugged into the outlet. This device pairs with the second plugin upstairs, which then runs an ethernet cable out. This used to go straight to my PC and I have had no issues with speed. Now however, I have plugged this into a Netgear ethernet switch, subsequently taking two other ethernet cable and plugging one into my PC and one to hers. 

At this point we noticed her speeds dropping drastically. An LED indicator on the Netgear plug, the ""Pick A Plug LED"", shines amber. This indicates speed going between 50-80Mbps. When I shut my PC down, the light turns green, indicating speeds greater than 80Mbps. 

I hope I provided enough info.  At this point, I'm not sure how to remedy this issue without new hardware. I suspect I will be buying a second set of ethernet over power plugs just for her PC, or getting a ridiculously long ethernet cable to run upstairs. This home is a rental so there is no wiring the place up like I would do as a homeowner.

&amp;#x200B;

I am attempting to connect this USB to HDMI adaptor to one of my monitors, [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TT6WZ7V/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_image\_o03\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TT6WZ7V/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

&amp;#x200B;

I can confirm that the monitor in question is plugged in correctly and working, because when I plug it directly into the HDMI slot on my laptop it connects fine, however when plugged into the USB adaptor the monitor in question will not recognize the signal.

I have also confirmed that I am plugging the adaptor into the USB 3.0 slot (with the blue coloring on the slot)

It did not automatically install the driver as far as I could tell

The adaptor came with a small CD, which I assume was for the driver software - however I do not have a CD slot on this computer to put it in, so when I plugged in the adaptor it asked me something like 'what do you want the computer to do when you plug this in' so I selected run as a CD, which brought up a list of 2 drivers for install, one for windows 7-10 and one for windows XP. I installed the Windows 7-10 driver, which I can confirm is in the devices list under XXX display.

&amp;#x200B;

However, after doing and restarting the computer, as well as uninstalling, reinstalling and restarting again, it still does not recognize the signal.

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering if - because I told it to run as a CD (every time I plug it in, it brings up the driver list for install again) that it is not loading it correctly and perhaps I need to change the setting that causes it to run as a CD? If that's the case, I do not know how to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;The adaptor came with a small CD, which I assume was for the driver software - however I do not have a CD slot on this computer to put it in, so when I plugged in the adaptor it asked me something like &amp;#39;what do you want the computer to do when you plug this in&amp;#39; so I selected run as a CD, which brought up a list of 2 drivers for install, one for windows 7-10 and one for windows XP. I installed the Windows 7-10 driver, which I can confirm is in the devices list under XXX display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after doing and restarting the computer, as well as uninstalling, reinstalling and restarting again, it still does not recognize the signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am wondering if - because I told it to run as a CD (every time I plug it in, it brings up the driver list for install again) that it is not loading it correctly and perhaps I need to change the setting that causes it to run as a CD? If that&amp;#39;s the case, I do not know how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think it&amp;#39;s something else or have advice on how to do that please let me know! Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

I have a Windows 10 laptop with the Qualcomm Atheros AR956X Wireless Network Adapter and it keeps disconnecting. I always sleep my laptop at the end of the day and sometimes when I wake it up the next day, the adapter is disconnected and I can't find any networks. Sometimes my laptop will freeze or blue screen and when I restart, it also is disconnected.  It's been happening more and more frequently and it's *extremely frustrating*. I think it started happening 2 years ago, maybe once every few months, and now it's multiple times a week. 

To get it working again, I have to spend over an hour restarting, uninstalling, and disabling the adapter and laptop randomly in hopes that it will somehow reconnect. I haven't noticed a pattern that will always work, it will just decide to connect again whenever it feels like it, I guess. I've tried everything that comes up online - disabling and reenabling, not allowing it to turn off to save power, troubleshooting, and nothing ever sticks. In a few days, it'll happen again. 

The code I usually get when it's in hidden devices in device manager is 'Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer. (Code 45)'. So I assume the physical adapter is loose or something? But I try my hardest to not move my laptop and it still disconnects. It will work at 11 pm one night, I sleep it, don't touch it, and the next morning, it's disconnected. And I don't do anything physically with my laptop that causes it to eventually reconnect. I want to avoid having to open up my laptop if possible so I want to see if anyone here knows what is going on.

So of course every web search result is about mysteriously losing space, or deleting files not affecting leftover free space. I have the opposite issue.

I recently did the Windows refresh -with keeping media files- thing, then redownloaded my Ninite stuff and games. I got a priced to move 2070 Super (so someone out there got their 3070), and wanted to be sure bloatware leftovers etc. wouldn't be slowing things down. Boot/logging in was creeping back to 7200rpm levels at least in my head. And the Windows ""reinstall"" did the trick. I also confirmed nothing from My Music/Pictures/Movies/Docs was deleted.

**FOR THE RECORD: I DID DELETE ""WINDOWS.OLD"", RAN DISK CLEANUP AS ADMIN, ALL THE BASICS TO FREE UP SPACE ON THE C: DRIVE.**

My SSD is only 512, so I was pushing it to its limit just initially to test out some old games to see how they'd run now. Hitman 1 being the biggest. Oh, and I got cheap Game Pass. So I had taken the SSD down to just 25GB free of the 476 possible.

A week or so later, after trying out a bunch of software to see what I liked best (example: irfan, xnview, faststone, digikam, and restoring Windows Live Photo Viewer with a registry edit) I decided to do a system restore to the day before, figuring more so than Revo or whatever it'd be the best way to make sure there's no leftover registry entries bogging things down.

The system restore failed, however, and I didn't think to write down the error message. But I didn't think anything of it, uninstalled stuff manually, and everything seemed fine until the next day I notice:

Free space on C: is now 75GB! That is a huge difference! Nothing seems to be deleted from the My Name folders, and all my games seem to be installed still, especially the biggest ones who could make a 50GB difference were they deleted -Forza Horizon 4 and Hitman-.

If this is an error in Windows reading how much space is truly left, I worry that it'll start overwriting my stuff on space it thinks is free.

,techsupport,"TL;DR Have system stutter in Windows, can't fresh install Windows to another drive without BSoD, even after a bunch of components have been swapped.

Current Specs after swapping hardware: [https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/36098791](https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/36098791)

Sensors while I ran benchmark, PerfCap Reason spike is during benchmark: [https://i.imgur.com/qs4rLY6.png](https://i.imgur.com/qs4rLY6.png)

Been screwing with this for a while with various fresh Windows installs between steps and changing out hardware, so here’s the rough timeline of what I can remember. Nothing has been clocked at any time.

\- Problem started as BSoD while playing a non-demanding game.

\-(I think) I did a reinstall and the BSoD started when I wasn’t gaming. I turned on dumps, here’s an old thread that includes them if you’re curious.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/jb3fl7/analyzed\_blue\_screen\_of\_death\_logs\_with\_windbg/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/jb3fl7/analyzed_blue_screen_of_death_logs_with_windbg/)

\- Temp was a little high, changed out stock cooler to ARCTIC Freezer 7 X

\-Ran Memtest86, no issues with RAM. Started changing module orders and eventually got the stop errors to stop for a month. I then put the RAM in the original slots and wasn’t able to replicate problem again (WTF?) and sent mine in under warranty.

\- Changed out RAM from Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2 X 8GB) DDR4 3600

\- FINALLY got things running smooth for a few days and then started getting crazy stutter in Windows and in games. Sometimes things like File Explorer or Firefox would crash. Sometimes I’d type and my cursor would freeze and then pop out all of the letters at once. Scrolling would sometimes freeze for a second.

\- Through GPU-Z, I noticed when the stutter would happen, an HDD that stored all my User files would spike hard in task manager. Moved files to C drive SSD and unplugged it and all other additional drives.

\- Was okay for a few hours (started planning on replacing the drive and setting up NAS as you’ll see my .text doc), then started again. Captured a minor instance of the stutter, notice that the Task Manager stutters when I resize it, and the menu bar flickers in my notepad. I was trying to show that when it stutters, you can see the CPU (task manager) and the GPU Clock frequencies spike during the stutter. GPU temp presumably spikes because of OBS studio recording.  [https://youtu.be/3HH7dAeuFys](https://youtu.be/3HH7dAeuFys)

\- Decided to try another smaller SSD that I have. Couldn’t get Windows to install on it because it would BSoD during installation. Afraid to reformat the larger SSD because it doesn’t blue screen right now.

\- Updated Bios, Reformatted everything for UEFI, turned off any legacy support in my Bios that I could find. Finally got it installed but it would BSoD every 10-30 minutes. Also stutters, but not as bad.

\- Replaced my GIGABYTE B450 AORUS PRO WIFI MoBo with MSI MAG B550 Gaming Plus today. When I was unscrewing the CPU cooler, the suction created by the thermal paste ripped the CPU out of the socket, ughhhhh, but nothing appears damaged. Fresh install looked something like this:

Reformatted and cleaned smaller SSD. Plugged in bare minimum to MoBO including CPU cooler, both RAM sticks, GPU, tower peripherals &amp; speaker, keyboard and mouse. BSoD during install, so attempted again and got it installed. Finally, in Windows, BSoD. In an act of desperation, I slapped in an old 550Ti GPU and still BSoD. Plugged in original SSD and Windows loads from that without the BSoD but with the lag. Not sure what to do at this point, might try a 256 GB SSD from a laptop that I have lying around I’ve changed out almost everything.  


Edit: Here are BSoD logs that are about 5 minutes apart that I was getting on a clean drive after an install.

I’m trying to flash the bios for my x570 tomahawk so that it will boot with my 5800x.

I don’t think the mobo is recognizing my USB. I’ve used a 16gb one that didn’t do anything and an 8gb one that was flashing on the USB, but there were no LEDs flashing on the board. Both USBs are FAT32 format.

I’m also a bit worried because people say the chipset fan turns on. I haven’t had the fan turn on at all on my board.

Any ideas for how to fix this? When I turn the power to my PSU on, am I supposed to see the fan turn on, debug LEDs turn on, and maybe RGB turn on? Is something wrong with my mobo? Let me know what you think. Thanks for your time.

1.I've tried installing an older version of my graphics card driver.

2.I've scanned Windows and checked for missing/corrupt files.

3.When I'm in safe mode the problem doesn't occur

4. I've turned off all startup apps.

5.I ran apex legends for about 10 minutes and there were no issues.

Please help me as I spent a lot of money on this PC and I feel very frustrated right now. I'm starting to think that I should've just bought a prebuilt like I did before.

&lt;p&gt;So I build got my CPU and GPU from a prebuilt Dell PC and put it in the new PC on 11/25/2020 and up until 11/27/2020 it was running perfectly, but around 11pm that day after I turned it on I noticed that it would freeze around 1 minute after I boot into Windows and it would stay frozen for about 30 seconds, in the mean time the screen turns blue for about 15 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*END CONTEXT*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*TRIED TROUBLESHOOTING*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.I&amp;#39;ve tried installing an older version of my graphics card driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.I&amp;#39;ve scanned Windows and checked for missing/corrupt files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.When I&amp;#39;m in safe mode the problem doesn&amp;#39;t occur&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;ve turned off all startup apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.I ran apex legends for about 10 minutes and there were no issues.&lt;/p&gt;

Let me know if you need more info.

Hey all. My pc freezes while playing games like Escape from Tarkov or Warzone which are fairly demanding games.

This used to happen but when i replaced my power supply along with RAM and GPU it appears to have fixed. But when i downloaded Tarkov and booted it up, the problem came back.

Now,every time I play a somewhat demanding game, it freezes my entire pc and the only way to get back to desktop is to restart my pc.

Methods I’ve tried:
-Downloading new drivers
-Reinstalling windows
-Setting graphics to low
-Running sfc/scannow in command prompt
-Checking temps and usage, everything seemed normal

So I thought it might be something with the drivers so I ended up purchasing and using ""DriverFix"" and it showed that my Realtek audio drivers could be updated, so I went along with it and after uninstalling the driver and restarting my computer, voila my mic started getting picked up and I was thrilled.

,techsupport,"Before anything else, I reinstalled this pump back onto the original Asus X99 motherboard it came off and it functions properly on that motherboard. Pump failure is not my issue and I took the time to verify that the pump does in fact still work. I borrowed another Corsair H115i AIO from a friend, installed it and it also does not operate on the MSI mobo, but works properly on the ASUS X99 mobo.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I know this is a long post but I want to put up all the info I have to avoid suggestions I've already implemented. I appreciate any help offered as I've run out of ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a new build, and Windows is not yet installed. The system posts properly and I can enter BIOS. All case fans operate properly and as the CPU temps rise the case fans are all ramping up as they are supposed to. Only the AIO pump does not operate as it should.

&amp;#x200B;

The cooler is a Corsair H110i GTX. It's old, I know, but it looks good with the new parts and more importantly it still does a good job with no air bubble noise. I would prefer not to replace it if I can avoid it. The cost isn't my concern, rather the quality of newer AIOs is lower and they all look pretty awful.

&amp;#x200B;

The cooler has 4 leads. The USB lead I have plugged into JUSB1 header. The Sata power lead is plugged into the PSU through a SATA power cable. The fan lead splits to run the radiator's two 140mm fans. The single wire ending in a 3-pin plug is connected to the CPU\_Fan\_1 header.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the same way I installed it on my previous X99 mobo. But my results are not the same on the MSI motherboard and I can't seem to figure out why.

&amp;#x200B;

* The Corsair logo illuminates properly. 
* The radiator fans both activate properly.
* The pump does not activate.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately without the pump I have a limited time to fart around in the MSI bios which I am very unfamiliar with. I'd also prefer not not run the CPU at 100C while fumbling around. Of course since there is a ticking clock as soon as I turn on the PC my IQ is reduced by half and I lose my ability to control a mouse because reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

What I have already managed to try based on local suggestions:

* Connect a regular fan to CPU\_Fan\_1 to see if a fan runs off that header. Fan operates properly, header is not faulty.
* Connect the AIO pump 3-pin lead to the PUMP\_FAN1 header. No change, PUMP\_FAN1 header will also operate a fan properly and is not faulty.
* Connect the AIO pump 3-pin lead to a SYS\_FAN lead. No change.
* Connect the AIO pump 3-pin lead to the PSU directly using a molex to 3-pin adapter. No change, using voltage tester direct power from the Molex plug is not 12V. I believe the pump needs a 12V signal. 
* In BIOS switch fan from PWM to DC. I have done this but unlike the BIOS in my previous PC there is no ""apply"" button so I'm not sure the changes I'm making are even taking effect.
* Allow the CPU to reach higher temps to see if the pump kicks in at higher temps - Eventually I get a message that the CPU is overheating and the PC shuts down. I would prefer not to have that happen again and would prefer not to even attempt another similar strategy.
* In BIOS switch the voltage manually to 12V. I've entered BIOS several times and as I am unfamiliar with the MSI BIOS have not found how/where to do this. The CPU temps start climbing over 90C and I have to shut down.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on about 6 hours of reading last night, I'm thinking the AIO waterpump needs a 12V signal to activate and is not getting a full 12V signal. The waterpump should be running 100% at all times unlike the fans and requires a simple 12V signal to activate. The mobo does not support my ancient AIO because it doesn't use the current standard AIO hookup.

I borrowed another Corsair H115i AIO from a friend, installed it and it also does not operate on the MSI mobo, but works properly on the ASUS X99 mobo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I know this is a long post but I want to put up all the info I have to avoid suggestions I&amp;#39;ve already implemented. I appreciate any help offered as I&amp;#39;ve run out of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a new build, and Windows is not yet installed. The system posts properly and I can enter BIOS. All case fans operate properly and as the CPU temps rise the case fans are all ramping up as they are supposed to. Only the AIO pump does not operate as it should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cooler is a Corsair H110i GTX. It&amp;#39;s old, I know, but it looks good with the new parts and more importantly it still does a good job with no air bubble noise. I would prefer not to replace it if I can avoid it. The cost isn&amp;#39;t my concern, rather the quality of newer AIOs is lower and they all look pretty awful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cooler has 4 leads. The USB lead I have plugged into JUSB1 header. The Sata power lead is plugged into the PSU through a SATA power cable. The fan lead splits to run the radiator&amp;#39;s two 140mm fans. The single wire ending in a 3-pin plug is connected to the CPU_Fan_1 header.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the same way I installed it on my previous X99 mobo. But my results are not the same on the MSI motherboard and I can&amp;#39;t seem to figure out why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Corsair logo illuminates properly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The radiator fans both activate properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pump does not activate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately without the pump I have a limited time to fart around in the MSI bios which I am very unfamiliar with. I&amp;#39;d also prefer not not run the CPU at 100C while fumbling around. Of course since there is a ticking clock as soon as I turn on the PC my IQ is reduced by half and I lose my ability to control a mouse because reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I have already managed to try based on local suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect a regular fan to CPU_Fan_1 to see if a fan runs off that header. Fan operates properly, header is not faulty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect the AIO pump 3-pin lead to the PUMP_FAN1 header. No change, PUMP_FAN1 header will also operate a fan properly and is not faulty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect the AIO pump 3-pin lead to a SYS_FAN lead. No change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect the AIO pump 3-pin lead to the PSU directly using a molex to 3-pin adapter. No change, using voltage tester direct power from the Molex plug is not 12V. I believe the pump needs a 12V signal. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In BIOS switch fan from PWM to DC. I have done this but unlike the BIOS in my previous PC there is no &amp;quot;apply&amp;quot; button so I&amp;#39;m not sure the changes I&amp;#39;m making are even taking effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow the CPU to reach higher temps to see if the pump kicks in at higher temps - Eventually I get a message that the CPU is overheating and the PC shuts down. I would prefer not to have that happen again and would prefer not to even attempt another similar strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In BIOS switch the voltage manually to 12V. I&amp;#39;ve entered BIOS several times and as I am unfamiliar with the MSI BIOS have not found how/where to do this. The CPU temps start climbing over 90C and I have to shut down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on about 6 hours of reading last night, I&amp;#39;m thinking the AIO waterpump needs a 12V signal to activate and is not getting a full 12V signal. The waterpump should be running 100% at all times unlike the fans and requires a simple 12V signal to activate. The mobo does not support my ancient AIO because it doesn&amp;#39;t use the current standard AIO hookup. As the signal cable connected to CPU_FAN_1 is a single one direction signal wire , the mobo is not detecting power draw from CPU_Fan_1 and therefore is not sending a signal to the pump to fire up.&lt;/p&gt;

,techsupport,"My Macbook has had a screen problem for over half a year. I've had 3 screen-changes;

1st time: Lines started appearing at the bottom of my screen. The longer the computer was on, the more of the screen, the lines would cover. I paid $800 for a new screen, but the problem very quickly returned

2nd time: I took the computer back to the repair-place, and they said it was a problem with the heating, so they had a look at it, and I picked it up the next day. And the problem was still there. Then they blamed the display I think? So again, hey had it for about a day, I picked it up the next day, and the problem was still there, so they changed the screen a second time.

3rd time: It didn't take long before the lines started appearing, but at this time, the school year had started, and I am very depedent on my cimpuer for my school work. We use computers in every subject, for every test and to every assignment, so I learned to live with the lines on the screen. Often those screen would fill up half of the screen during a school day. One day though, while I was charging, the computer started smoking. So I went back to the place and told them that my computer smoked when it was charging, and that the screen was still broken. They looked at it, and told me that one of the ports were burned and the other one was fine-ish. They kept the computer for a couple of days and found out that the charger was at fault, they said that the charger (original apple charger) probably created some interference, which caused the lines on the screen, so I went and bought a new charger. When I charged with the new charger, the lines still appeared on my screen, so I went back with the computer. They kept the computer for 2 weeks this time, and changed the screen for a 3rd time, and finally, there were no lines.

But when I tried to charge my computer, with the new charger in the port that wasn't burned, smoke came from it again. The new charger was a sinox charger, which the repair place had said was a good alternative to the original apple charger. I figured that maybe the sinox charger was making my computer smoke because it was a copy, and not original apple, so I borrowed my mate's orignal apple charger, but her charger quickly started to smell burnt as well. I'm really frustrated and at loss as to what I should do. My Macbook was very expensive and not even 4 years old. I don't know what to do with it, or if it's fixable, and I'm losing my trust in the repair-place. Has anyone had similar problems or maybe have some advice for my situation?

One day though, while I was charging, the computer started smoking. So I went back to the place and told them that my computer smoked when it was charging, and that the screen was still broken. They looked at it, and told me that one of the ports were burned and the other one was fine-ish. They kept the computer for a couple of days and found out that the charger was at fault, they said that the charger (original apple charger) probably created some interference, which caused the lines on the screen, so I went and bought a new charger. When I charged with the new charger, the lines still appeared on my screen, so I went back with the computer. They kept the computer for 2 weeks this time, and changed the screen for a 3rd time, and finally, there were no lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I tried to charge my computer, with the new charger in the port that wasn&amp;#39;t burned, smoke came from it again. The new charger was a sinox charger, which the repair place had said was a good alternative to the original apple charger. I figured that maybe the sinox charger was making my computer smoke because it was a copy, and not original apple, so I borrowed my mate&amp;#39;s orignal apple charger, but her charger quickly started to smell burnt as well. I&amp;#39;m really frustrated and at loss as to what I should do. My Macbook was very expensive and not even 4 years old. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do with it, or if it&amp;#39;s fixable, and I&amp;#39;m losing my trust in the repair-place. Has anyone had similar problems or maybe have some advice for my situation? The Macbook is a Macpook pro, 2017 model, 13&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

,techsupport,"Heya, so the following problem is a result of a mistake i made like 3 years ago, following several years of me just ignoring it in hopes of it eventually sorting itself out.

So three years ago I was using the Spotify windows App, and one day it had some issue (i think it was something like it would just play about 20 songs on loop despite me playing a playlist that was way longer than that or something, but thats not really relevant.) anyways a friend of mine had had the same issue and he said he fixed it by reinstalling the app; seems logical. So when we we're done gaming he went to bed and I thought I would just fix it real quick before going to sleep aswell.Now, i was very new to pc, so i didn't particularly know what to do, I knew most apps i had wanted to delete thus far had a delete option in the app itself, but spotify didnt.Now this is where i fucked up, i just thought i'd delete the files. Bad idea.It was deleting spotify's files, when it hit an administrator file, which required an extra confirmation and had the classic warning that wrote something along the lines of ''deleting this could fuck ya system up'' i ofcourse, didn't like the sound of that, and did not delete those.

Then i went to reinstall spotify; it did it, no problem.. however now there was no longer any music on it. My playlists and everything were there, but they were completely empty.  


I just switched to the WebApp instead. Now in hindsight i know i should've used the delete feature in the ''apps &amp; features'' tab in the system setting. But i didn't, and it no longer shows up there, when i reinstall the app it just deletes the one it just installed but those files that i didnt delete 3 years ago remain. 

&amp;#x200B;

But now it's like 3 years later, the WebApp fuckin' sucks and i want the Windows App back.I checked, it still does the same thing.Is there any way to salvage this? do i just delete those admin files and hope for the best or is there some less spooky way of doing this?

,techsupport,"Hello!

I am currently attempting to help remotely troubleshoot my sister's PC - it has been crashing frequently and my theory was the CPU as the current cooling seems questionable. However, I was astounded upon installing HWM when reading the temperature sensors, particularly as this was just during normal running without any stress testing:

Package: Min: 9C Max: 56C

Core: Min: 58C Max: 105C

Obviously something is wrong with the sensors as the room is very warm and that 9C reading can't be possible, and that 105 is concerning to say the least! I had my sister check the heatsink - it is running and feels warm but not hot. All other temperature sensors within the motherboard report between 20-33C. What's likely the issue here? Obviously if the 105C value is correct then this is a big problem and likely the culprit of the frequent crashes, but what could have caused this whopping temperature difference and why doesn't the unit feel hot?

I was using the wrong cable with the power supply for a while but switched to the right cable and the problem still occurs.

I have ran the windows memory diag and everything was fine.

I have reseated the VGA and disconnected the wifi adapter and cd drive.

I have reseated the RAM.

I have started the PC with no USB peripherals and the problem persists.

I have updated Nvidia drivers.

I thought it may have been the voltage switch between 240v in Indonesia and 110v in the US that caused it but I used a transformer to up the voltage and the problem still happened. Also the psu can take both 110 and 240.

I have cleared CMOS and reset BIOS recently and I am going to leave the PC off for a few days to see if the problem persists.

I'm hoping someone can help me understand something.

I have a router from my ISP that I run in ""modem-mode"", letting my Netgear Orbi act as a router to do all DHCP for my home network.

The ISP modem seems to have a LAN-side IP of [192.168.0.1](https://192.168.0.1) (default) but my Orbi is on [192.168.1.1](https://192.168.1.1) and issues DHCP IPs within the 192.168.1.2-254 range.

**Should my ISP modem and Orbi not be on the same 192.168.1.x subnet?**

Clients can mostly access internet on wifi fine with one exception- maybe it's unrelated but I'm having issues with some specific client applications not being able to communicate on the wifi properly. Generally speaking these are Facebook-owned mobile apps including Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp. If I want to call someone on Whatsapp I have to ""jumpstart"" the call on my 4G connection and then turn on the wifi and the call continues on the wifi, trying to initiate the call on wifi doesnt work.

,techsupport,"I’ll be building a new PC in a couple of weeks once all the parts arrive. My current rig was working perfectly fine until I decided to remove one of the GPU’s to sell it.

Current Rig Specs
- CPU i7-6700K
- GPU Gigabyte 980 Ti (was two in SLI)
- Mobo MSI Z170A
- OS Windows 10

So like I said the PC was working fine until I removed one of the 980 Ti’s a couple of weeks ago then I started getting crashes while gaming. I used DDU to completely remove all the GPU drivers, reinstalled fresh drivers, and used MSI live update to update anything associated with the motherboard. This appeared to fix the problem for about a week.

Last night I was playing a game for about an hour, then exited so I could let my toddler do her midnight pee, went to start up the same game and crashed like 5 mins in. My game room was a little warmer than usual so I thought maybe the GPU was overheating. I used OC Guru II to adjust my fan curve to a more aggressive setting, then I crashed immediately on game startup.

Now I can’t even boot into Windows at all. I can boot into safe mode but safe mode won’t allow me to run OC Guru II to change the setting back.

During the original crashes I used WhoCrashed to determine it’s definitely a GPU issue. All the dump logs point towards that being the issue, but I’m stumped as to why I can’t even get into Windows anymore.

FWIW, I double checked all power connectors for everything in the rig, made sure my GPU and RAM are seated properly, all fans seems to be spinning ok, no debug LEDs are going off.

,techsupport,"I'm having a weird issue with my USB-C dock, an [Icybox ib-dk4050-cpd](https://www.raidsonic.de/en/standards/searchresults.php?we_objectID=6089). When I connect a laptop to it, the colour reproduction on the external monitor, attached to the dock's HDMI port, seems fine, except that the top and bottom end on the monochrome range blends together completely. This does not happen when I use the built-in HDMI of the laptop.

Here's an approximation of the problem: https://i.imgur.com/RVfwpHO.png It's really noticeable in my e-mail program, which uses a faint grey as background colour every other row. It's invisible when I use the dock, except when another window's shadow darkens it. Then the striping is visible in the shadow, but nowhere else.

I've also taken a photo, the whole image should be bars of different shades, but the difference is only visible on the left: https://i.imgur.com/oYLyPJU.jpg

The problem doesn't happen with colours. A super-dark blue (\#000002) next to black still looks different, so does an ever so slightly lighter blue.

Troubleshooting steps and research done:

 * Tried multiple laptops, both Thinkpads though.
 * Tried Windows and Linux, same result.
 * Tried updating the dock's firmware.
 * Read up on similar issues, best lead I found was [HDMI RGB broadcast range](https://fhackts.wordpress.com/2015/02/10/forcing-hdmi-colorspace-to-full-on-intel-haswell-arch-linux/). Tried forcing it, no improvement. It already seems to be set up correctly.

,techsupport,"Hey, I hope somebody here can help me.

Some background:

I have recently bought a new video card and M.2. I was also still running windows 7 so I thought that might be a nice time to update. So I update windows 7 to 10 and got a licence connected to my windows account.

After installing the M.2 and the new video card I was able to install windows 10 from a USB drive to the M.2. Unfortunately my previous hard drives in Raid 1 were no longer visible. I was able to unplug the other two drives, my previous boot drive(ssd) and a storage drive  and use diskmanager to enable foreign disk and got the info on my hard drive visible again. That was the state this problem occurred in.

What happened:

So I started the PC, it booted properly from M.2 in Windows 10. I started ANNO 1800, played for a bit and all of a sudden the PC froze. Then a blue screen, it gave an error message but I was focused to try to get the QR read but I wasn't fast enough. So I thought, ok, that can happen, let's restart. But now when I try to boot from the M.2 it said: no boot device found (or something). So I thought I would see if I could repair it, to no avail. Then I thought, I will try to reinstall Windows 10 like I installed it before. It said: can't install to that drive because it's a GPT drive, which may be possible, but how did it install before then? Then I pressed format drive to see if that would make a difference, but it didn't.

So now I'm pretty lost. What can I do next? The M.2 is recognized in the BIOS, it just won't boot and it won't let me install Windows 10 to that one again. I'm using the  *Windows 10* media creation from windows.

My MB: GA-Z97X-SLI  
M.2: Samsung 980 PRO 500GB  
OS: Windows 10 Pro

I read I should turn on UEFI, It says DUAL BIOS/UEFI in my BIOS screen. I think it's turned on but maybe not. I wouldn't know where else to turn it on.

I've put Windows as flair. It used to work before so I doubt it's a hardware problem, it appears a windows thing to me.

Any help is much appreciated.

The results are really close, and the second run the temps maxed out at 49C and 56C. I feel that that is too low to thermal throttle. Since the first run was about the same I feel good. &lt;/p&gt;

One of the things was a complete PC which had been plugged in during a lighting strike and wouldn't work properly since.

Details of the PC:
Intel i3-6100
Gigabyte h110m-h
8GB DDR4 
480GB SSD
GTX 1050
A cheapo CIT SFX 400w PSU

The issue was the PC would lockup at a random interval between 1 minute and 5 minutes after boot up, when it did it would corrupt windows to the point that you'd need to reinstall from scratch.

He assumed it was a faulty mobo (can't remember why that conclusion) so brought a new identical one, and when that didn't fix it gave up and gave me both.

I swapped out all the components and tested in several different configurations etc, and tested each of those components in sperate computers, all of which where fine, and I've in-fact sold most of those parts since.

So at this point I was sure it was the CPU, in further testing I found that it works fine with Ubuntu, the UEFI works fine and you can even use the CPU to update the bios without issue, windows you can install using the CPU and will work fine in safe mode, however as soon as you boot up any version of Windows normally you run into the issue and it's corrupted all over again. Limiting the CPU to one core also makes no difference. It also passes every CPU test you can throw at it.

So go ahead, tell me what the hell could be the issue with the CPU and what setting etc could be changed to make it work like it does in safe mode or with Ubuntu.

Ok this thing has been bothering me for quite a while. Even if I snooze it, it still comes back after a while. It's not that I want to disable some important feature of Windows; I am aware I have update waiting to be installed, it's just that I prefer to keep my laptop running for long times without restarts and it's always worked out fine for me, but now it essentialy forces me to restart every few days because there are always some updates.

I've looked around the internet and there are some suggestions as to there being a possibilty of turning it off via Group Policy. I went in there and tweaked various things and it didn't work, but I'll be honest with you and say that I don't fully understand what those policies do (the descriptions are often very confabulated). I consider myself a power user but the level of confabulation is just too dense for me to understand anything basically.

Can somebody please enlighten me and tell me which exact setting do I tweak in order for this to go away?

I'll start this off by saying my level of expertise on the tech world is novice. I understand a little bit and can google with the best of them but figured I'd ask you fine people.

I have a dual monitor set up currently but only use 1 of them due to being a 1440p 144HZ and for gaming. I woke up this morning and the main monitor was black and had switched screens to my 1080p monitor which was weird. I went to display settings and switched it back and all seemed okay. Starting gaming and was getting constant stuttering issues and FPS drops. Went to AMD website and tried updating drivers but got to 90%  and then got error 1603 and it couldn't complete. I tried restarting the PC in safe mode but it sat at the restarting screen for 20 mins before rebooting itself back into normal boot up.

 I finally gave up and reinstalled windows but the problem remains. Im getting stuttering moving the mouse across the screen, youtube videos have audio stuttering, restarts take 3 4 mins when before I could do a system reboot in 20 seconds.

Any ideas as to why this is? As far as I know, GPUs don’t “degrade” over time, right? I tried cleaning the small amount of dust I had too but no dice. I am still pushing a HDD too, though, so could that be it? Been planning on buying an SSD soon, so hopefully that’d fix it.

,techsupport,"Hi all,

I have recently bought a new customized PC (I didn't customize it myself but I paid a company to build the PC for me). It is built to play games on 4K at maximum or close to maximum graphic settings.

Here are the specs:

CPU

• INTEL CORE i9-10900K PROCESSOR

CPU COOLER

• CORSAIR H115i RGB PLATINUM AIO CPU COOLER

MOTHERBOARD

• MSI MPG Z490 GAMING PLUS

MEMORY

• 32GB (2x16GB) PATRIOT VIPER STEEL DDR4 3200MHZ

GRAPHICS CARD (GPU)

• MSI RTX 3080 VENTUS 3X 10G OC

PRIMARY STORAGE

• 1TB PATRIOT VPN100 M.2 (3450MB R &amp; 3000MB W)

SECONDARY STORAGE

• 1TB PATRIOT BURST 2.5"" SSD

POWER SUPPLY

• CORSAIR RM850 80PLUS GOLD POWER SUPPLY

I have had the computer for 5 days, used for about 3 hours a day, and it has crashed a total of 4 times. These crashes have so far happened only while gaming. I have used HWInfo to monitor my GPU temperature, and the maximum it has hit is 83 degrees celsius while gaming on maximum settings, 4k, on Shadow of the Tomb Raider.

The 4 shutdowns happened on the following games, all settings maxed out, at 4k resolution:

1. Shadow of the Tomb Raider
2. Dota 2
3. Final Fantasy 14 (twice)

The PC turns on automatically after the shutdown. 

During the last shutdown with Final Fantasy 14, I had HWInfo record a log, and when I looked at the final record before it crashed, the GPU temperature is at 75 degrees celsius.

I'm a little stump as to what the issue might be. I have Googled and there seems to be 2 potential reasons for this shutdown: GPU too hot such that it forced a shutdown &amp; Not enough power from the PSU.

Could I seek some advice over here? Is there a program I could use to track what may have caused the shutdown?

,techsupport,"Hello fellow user, I don't know if this is a hardware or a software problem. So what happened was, I was playing Assassin's Creed Unity, and my PC suddenly froze. I was wearing the headphones, and there was a static repeating. So I waited 2 minutes, tried Alt-Tab and Ctrl-Alt-Del, but it just wouldn't budge, so I tried to turn off my PC. I clicked the power button, but it wouldn't turn it off too. So I went to the back and turned off the power to the whole PC, eventually turning everything off. So I tried to turn it on again, and the PC turned on, but my monitor wasn't receiving it.

Hi all. I'm pulling my hair out trying to figure this out. I started streaming on Twitch using my Rode NT-USB. For the first two days my mic was perfect. Then out of nowhere just yesterday when I wanted to stream, there was a static sound whenever I spoke into my mic.

Here's a sample recording. Really dragged out my words so you can hear it. [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1105neVjfZB2UuuuXV6RSJsRhNC6ORP4N/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1105neVjfZB2UuuuXV6RSJsRhNC6ORP4N/view?usp=sharing)

Again, it's only when I plug this into my Windows 10 computer that it gets outputted with this static. If I plug in headphones directly into my mic, or if I plug my mic into my Macbook, it sounds fine.

Someone PLEASE help me with this. I'm just at a loss.

So I decided to buy a larger micro SD card. I looked up how to transfer data from micro SD card to another micro SD card and I did the steps. I formatted the new SD card, copied the Nintendo folder from my old SD card to my (Mac) desktop, inserted the new SD card, moved files from old SD card to new one and replaced the files, then popped that sucker back into my Switch and...there were issues.
 
It recognized that it was a 256GB micro SD card and that files had been inserted.

However, when I run a speed test, the speed for my pc is around 4 mbps. I considered contacting my ISP, but the thing is is that the issue only exists for my PC. I&amp;#39;ve tried a speed test on my phone from the same room where I have my computer. I get around 20-21 mbps, which seems about right. The issue must be on my side. I&amp;#39;ve looked into this &lt;a href=""https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/slow-internet-speeds-on-only-one-computer-solved.1943039/""&gt;Post.&lt;/a&gt; It says an AMD softare was the culprit, so I decided to see if I had anything like that, which I did not. I&amp;#39;ve also done a virus/malware check. Clean. Not too tech savvy, so I do apoligize if the solution is rather simple.  &lt;/p&gt;

The crackling is present on every audio device I've checked: two different headphones, two monitors and speakers in combination with the rear panel 3.5mm, front panel 3.5mm, multiple USB ports and Display Port. I don't currently have devices/cables on hand to try HDMI or S/PDIF.

Things I've tried so far:

* Updated/reinstalled audio drivers

* Tried older audio drivers

* Reinstalled windows 10

* Changed the audio format to lower frequencies

* Disabled audio enhancements

* Disabled exclusive control mode

* Changed power settings to high performance power mode

* Checked DPC latency using LatencyMon which said the problem might be related to power management or CPU throttling.
Turned off CPU power throttling through a registry key and cmd commands, no dice.

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;The crackling is present on every audio device I&amp;#39;ve checked: two different headphones, two monitors and speakers in combination with the rear panel 3.5mm, front panel 3.5mm, multiple USB ports and Display Port. I don&amp;#39;t currently have devices/cables on hand to try HDMI or S/PDIF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things I&amp;#39;ve tried so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updated/reinstalled audio drivers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tried older audio drivers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reinstalled windows 10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changed the audio format to lower frequencies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disabled audio enhancements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disabled exclusive control mode&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changed power settings to high performance power mode&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Checked DPC latency using LatencyMon which said the problem might be related to power management or CPU throttling.
Turned off CPU power throttling through a registry key and cmd commands, no dice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t seem to be having any other issues like lagging games or low fps, everything works fine except for the audio popping. Could the old GPU be causing problems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I don&amp;#39;t find the exact cause of the issue, would a dedicated sound card definitely fix it?&lt;/p&gt;

First time ever posting on reddit so please bear with me. Exactly a week ago today I bought a name brand TV. I am not sure if I am allowed to drop brand names here but it starts with an ""S"" and has the past participle of the word ""sing"" in it. It is a 55inch QLED TV.

**ISSUE:** After purchasing said TV from the blue and yellow electronic store and setting it up and using it for about a week I noticed this white ""dust"", if you will, that began to form on the back panel of the TV and around the screen edges. Upon closer inspection it looks like this so called dust has outlined some of the interior components on the back panel. 

I contacted the TV brand's tech support and they had never seen anything like it. They told me to wipe it off and see if it comes back. I did not do that. I took it back to the blue and yellow electronic store and they, of course, had never seen anything like that but they thought it was defective so I got it swapped out with another TV, same brand and model etc. I am worried that this TV will begin doing the same thing as I think I can see some of this dust starting to form again. I got this new replacement TV yesterday.

**Facts:** I am meticulous with all my electronics in terms of keeping them clean and not putting them in places where they will get stuff on them. This TV was on a TV stand, not mounted. There is about 7-8in between the back panel and the wall. There is an air vent on the ceiling to the right of the tv and there is a door that goes to my balcony on the left of the tv. The router is on the right side of the tv and the modem is on the left side. Other than watching TV I play a lot of XBOX which is located underneath the TV in a little cubby on the stand.

I live in the Midwest so it is typical Midwest late fall weather. The TV was not exposed to anything. I had a 55inch regular LED TV in the same spot and never had this issue. Also, I am pretty good about dusting too. I have ruled out as many scenario's as I could. I do not believe it is mold based on my research so I have ruled that out.

I consider my self on a tech savviness scale of 1-10 at about a 6.4 to 7.1 depending on the technology. My curiosity has got the best of me and it is going to bug me until I figure out if it is something I am doing wrong or if I just got a faulty unit.

Working fine except when I plug a USB device, windows does not see it until I reboot my PC.

*  PC is unresponsive (keyboard/mouse does nothing)
* *single* press of  power button does nothing, long press shut down as expected.
* Reboot button on my case still work and reboot as expected (windows act as if nothing wrong happened)

After ~5min, my screen powers on and just display a black screen. At this point :

* a single press of the power button instantly shut down my pc (as if it was expecting this)
* if shut down, everything is normal when booting windows (whether I put it to sleep or shut down)
* I tried letting this state go and nothing happened (black screen on, fan running low) after ~10 hours

I did not reinstall or reset Windows but now wondering if necessary. Online advice doesn't seem to agree on a reset or not and I am reluctant to fully reset this pc as it hold a lot of installed apps, files and environment Path.

* Games opened will still work when this issue occur but will fail to close correctly and/thus saving data (eg can't save games when it occur)
* If opening Task manager, it will display 100% CPU being taken but will not report any app/exe using CPU  (and will become unresponsive shortly after)
* If Apps/Games are opened, they will *NOT* lag as if 100% Cpu was taken
* If I had my (xbox) controller plugged-in when booting my PC and it is not powered on, this issue will happen 100% of the time. If my controller is powered on, the issue will NOT happen (if not plugged in, it can happen)

I recently reassembled my PC after being away from home for a year. PC was working fine for many years before.

**Specs:**

* Windows 10
* Intel core I7-4790 3.6Ghz 8MB LGA1150
* MSI Z97 PC Mate Motherboard
* Corsair Vengeance 2x8GB DDR3
* ""WD 3.5"" 1TB Black SATA 64MB Cache 7200RPM HDD
* Samsung 120GB 840 EVO SSD
* NZXT H440 Case
* Cooler Master V 650SW 80+ Gold Power Supply
* EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB GAMING, ACX 2.0 (Single Fan), 3GB GDDR5, DX12 OSD Support (PXOC) Graphics Cards 03G-P4-6160-KR
* Cooler Master V8GTS Vapor CPU Cooler

**Steps I've taken:**

1. Tried manually shutting down the PC to invoke Troubleshoot menu. Diagnostic/repair tool fail to repair anything.
2. Unplug HDD so I am left with SSD that has the OS. Reset PC with Troubleshoot menu. Black screen issue still present.
3. Made a USB boot drive. Reinstalled Windows 10 Home. Successfully setup Windows 10 Home. Successfully updated drivers and what not (with a couple of mandatory restarts). Black screen issue seems fixed. But..
4. Plug HDD back in to test with reinstalled OS. Black screen issue returns.
5. Unplug HDD again. Reboot PC with just SSD. Black screen issue is still present.
6. So I repeated step 3 again. With HDD unplugged, I used the USB boot drive again to reinstall Windows. Black screen issue is gone.

I just bought a new 700 watt EVGA bronze power supply, and an RX 5700xt and put it in my computer. It was working fine for a week or so, but yesterday after booting the computer in the morning my second monitor was completely green, and my first monitor was flickering heavily. I decided to reseat the graphics card, clean drivers with DDU and fresh install to a stable version, and turn my PC on its side (turned it while it was off as not to dmg the HDD), and now its working again, but the screen flickers randomly and whenever I lightly tap my pc with two fingers, it flickers! 

I don't have another GPU or PSU so I can test which one of these isn't working right, but I have until Jan 16 to return both of them so I would appreciate any insight. I suspected the GPU was too heavy and I needed a brace, which is why my entire PC is on its side right now. Is there anything else I can do except return this GPU and buy Nvidia?

# /r/TechSupport's Wiki

Thanks for reading so far. We are looking to overhaul the Wiki and create a new one from scratch with updated relevant information. Years ago we had a wiki that was full of information but that is now lost and I doubt many would even remember it.  We have created a new Wiki on the platform called BookStack which can be found here - [https://rtech.support/](https://rtech.support/)

We would love to hear your thoughts on this platform, it is very much a work in progress and nothing really there yet but we want to build our repository of Wikis and information up.  Which also ties into the Flairs aspect, we want to ask for others to help contribute to building the Wiki. It would be advisable for you to join our Discord where you can talk to the Mods and other help in this regard and ask for peer help when creating documentation.

If you are interested in this and contributing please let us know by commenting below and we will reach out to you.

&amp;#x200B;

Anything else you want to mention not about the 3 areas mentioned here please let us know in the other comment thread. Please refrain from creating other threads. We are also exploring how we might best create templates for users and post so anything relating to this please let us know in the other feedback.

 *If you suspect you are infected with any form of malware that encrypts your files, DO NOT follow this guide! Please make a post instead. Your files are at stake.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Tip:** Windows 7 and below is no longer supported by Microsoft and UNSAFE to use. If you are still running Windows 7 with a LEGIT license, you can obtain a free upgrade to Windows 10 by using the [Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) from Microsoft. They have been very generous in continuing to allow users to upgrade from Windows 7 at no charge. *Do this upgrade AFTER your system has been cleaned of malware. A system image backup is highly recommended before starting this process. This backup can be performed to an external hard drive with the* [Backup &amp; Restore tool](https://i.imgur.com/B0I3FgI.png) *located in the Control Panel on Windows 7 and up.*

 

**Purpose &amp; Scope of this Guide:**

This guide is designed to assist you in removing malware from an infected system *that successfully boots*. If your computer is completely unable to boot due to malware, please make a post, as this guide will not help you. If you perform the following steps exactly as described, this will solve your problem in over 90% of scenarios. That said, not all malware is created equal, and not all malware removal tools are created equal. The tools recommended in this guide were picked because of their high success and low failure rates, measured on a very large scale. However, there will be times that this guide fails in removing malware. If that is the case, please make a post for further assistance, stating that this guide was unsuccessful. It is recommended to only accept advice from a “Trusted” technician. I am writing this guide in layman’s terms so that most people will be able to understand it with ease.

 

**Disclaimer:**

The following instructions are recommendations only. You take full responsibility for any steps you choose to perform on your computer. While the following recommendations are performed without issue on countless machines, there is always a risk of damaging your Operating System or experiencing data loss on any machine. **It is solely YOUR responsibility to save all work and back up any and all important data on your system before proceeding.** 

 

**Malware Remediation Steps:**

*Before proceeding, go into your browser’s extensions and remove all suspicious items. Also go into your browser’s settings and remove any default search providers and unusual homepages. If you are unsure how to do this, proceed to Step 1.*

 

*Download and run the following tools in this order. Run all tools unless otherwise instructed. All tools should be run in Normal Mode (not Safe Mode) unless you are unable to boot Normal Mode, or the scans fail in Normal Mode. All tools must be run under an Administrator account. Do not remove any tool-generated logs in the event a helper needs you to post them to further assist you.*

 

**1) Run** [**rkill.com**](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/dl/10/)**. Sometimes it takes a few minutes to finish. Do not reboot when done.**

* Kills running malicious processes
* Removes policies in the registry that prevent normal OS operation
* Repairs file extension hijacks

 

**2) Download an updated copy** [**Malwarebytes 4.0**](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/thankyou/)**. Turn on the “**[**Scan for Rootkits**](https://i.imgur.com/5lLJB3R.png)**” option. Then, run a “**[**Scan**](https://i.imgur.com/fDFSVy4.png)**”**

* Successfully removes the vast majority of infections
* Has an industry-leading, lightning fast scanning  &amp; heuristics engine
* Has built-in repair tools to fix damage done by malware

 

**3) Run** [**Malwarebytes ADWCleaner 8**](https://toolslib.net/downloads/viewdownload/1-adwcleaner/) **using the “**[**Scan Now**](https://i.imgur.com/hwFbaQZ.png)**” button.**

* Removes majority of adware, PuPs, Toolbars, and Browser hijacks
* Scans for bloatware &amp; pre-installed sofware and lets you quarantine any or all of it.
* Fixes proxy settings changed by malware
* Removes certain non-default browser settings

 

 

**Optional, Advanced Step (only run if previous tools fail to solve problem):**

**4) Run Sophos** [**HitmanPro**](http://get.hitmanpro.com/)

* [Here](https://i.imgur.com/oT7CjuN.png) is HitmanPro.

HitmanPro is a phenomenal ""second-opinion"" malware scanner. I recommend clicking ""Settings"" and uncheck ""Scan for tracking cookies"" before starting the scan. This will drastically reduce scan times. This tool can only be run ONCE for free. Use it wisely.

 

**Please note:** If malware has prohibited you from browsing the web or downloading files, you can try running the [NetAdapter Repair Tool](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/netadapter-repair-all-in-one/)  with [all options checked](http://i.imgur.com/XLv1ZUW.png) which will attempt to restore your internet connection &amp; default browser settings. You may have to download these tools on another computer and move them to a flash drive that you can plug into the infected machine.

 

**Think your Mac is infected?**

Try [Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for Mac](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mac/). Please make a post if it is unsuccessful.

 

If you have run all of the above tools successfully, you should be malware-free. If you are still experiencing problems, please make a post in /r/techsupport for further assistance.

 

**Follow-up Steps (highly recommended):**

* Using a computer that has not been infected, change passwords to all your online accounts.
* Consider enabling two-factor authentication on all accounts!
* Install a better anti-virus. See recommendations below.

 

**What is malware?**

[Malware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware) is an umbrella term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software, including computer viruses, worms, trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, scareware, and other malicious programs. It can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software. \[Source: Wikipedia.com\]

 

**How did I get infected?**

It is difficult to track down the source of an infection. Most infections are actually given permission to run unknowingly by the user. It is recommended to keep User Account Control turned on and never give access to something you do not trust or did not open. Many other infections come via exploits in your browser or browser plug-ins on websites you visit. Always be very careful what you install. Make sure you trust the source implicitly. When downloading programs, always use the publisher’s website directly.

 

**How to prevent future infections:**

Be very careful what you download and install. Keep your software up-to-date. Using [Ninite](http://ninite.com) for installing/updating software is very easy &amp; safe and uses official installers without adding extra software to your PC during installation. Make sure Windows is kept up-to-date as well, including Windows 10 feature updates. Many Windows updates patch exploits and vulnerabilities in your operating system. Most infections are active because the user has unknowingly given it Administrative permission to install and run. The first line of defense starts with you.

 

**The following tools will aide you in keeping your computer clean:**

 

**Free Anti-Virus Suggestions:**

* [Malwarebytes 4.0](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/thankyou/) (Next-generation anti-virus replacement, free version must be run MANUALLY)
* [BitDefender](http://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/free.html)
* [ESET Free Online Scanner](http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/)

Free AVs will only go so far. I highly recommend purchasing the AV of your choice to get better protection. Companies who offer products for free are usually making money off you one way or another. This has been [proven again recently with Avast](https://www.cnet.com/news/antivirus-firm-avast-is-reportedly-selling-users-web-browsing-data/). If you use Avast, uninstall it immediately.

**Helpful Tools:**

* [Malwarebytes 4.0](https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/) (Next-generation anti-virus replacement)

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Windows 7 and below is no longer supported by Microsoft and UNSAFE to use. If you are still running Windows 7 with a LEGIT license, you can obtain a free upgrade to Windows 10 by using the &lt;a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10""&gt;Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant&lt;/a&gt; from Microsoft. They have been very generous in continuing to allow users to upgrade from Windows 7 at no charge. &lt;em&gt;Do this upgrade AFTER your system has been cleaned of malware. A system image backup is highly recommended before starting this process. This backup can be performed to an external hard drive with the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/B0I3FgI.png""&gt;Backup &amp;amp; Restore tool&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;located in the Control Panel on Windows 7 and up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose &amp;amp; Scope of this Guide:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide is designed to assist you in removing malware from an infected system &lt;em&gt;that successfully boots&lt;/em&gt;. If your computer is completely unable to boot due to malware, please make a post, as this guide will not help you. If you perform the following steps exactly as described, this will solve your problem in over 90% of scenarios. That said, not all malware is created equal, and not all malware removal tools are created equal. The tools recommended in this guide were picked because of their high success and low failure rates, measured on a very large scale. However, there will be times that this guide fails in removing malware. If that is the case, please make a post for further assistance, stating that this guide was unsuccessful. It is recommended to only accept advice from a “Trusted” technician. I am writing this guide in layman’s terms so that most people will be able to understand it with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following instructions are recommendations only. You take full responsibility for any steps you choose to perform on your computer. While the following recommendations are performed without issue on countless machines, there is always a risk of damaging your Operating System or experiencing data loss on any machine. &lt;strong&gt;It is solely YOUR responsibility to save all work and back up any and all important data on your system before proceeding.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malware Remediation Steps:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before proceeding, go into your browser’s extensions and remove all suspicious items. Also go into your browser’s settings and remove any default search providers and unusual homepages. If you are unsure how to do this, proceed to Step 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download and run the following tools in this order. Run all tools unless otherwise instructed. All tools should be run in Normal Mode (not Safe Mode) unless you are unable to boot Normal Mode, or the scans fail in Normal Mode. All tools must be run under an Administrator account. Do not remove any tool-generated logs in the event a helper needs you to post them to further assist you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Run&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/dl/10/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rkill.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Sometimes it takes a few minutes to finish. Do not reboot when done.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kills running malicious processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removes policies in the registry that prevent normal OS operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repairs file extension hijacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Download an updated copy&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/thankyou/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malwarebytes 4.0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Turn on the “&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/5lLJB3R.png""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scan for Rootkits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;” option. Then, run a “&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/fDFSVy4.png""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successfully removes the vast majority of infections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has an industry-leading, lightning fast scanning  &amp;amp; heuristics engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has built-in repair tools to fix damage done by malware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Run&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://toolslib.net/downloads/viewdownload/1-adwcleaner/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malwarebytes ADWCleaner 8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;using the “&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/hwFbaQZ.png""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scan Now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;” button.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removes majority of adware, PuPs, Toolbars, and Browser hijacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scans for bloatware &amp;amp; pre-installed sofware and lets you quarantine any or all of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixes proxy settings changed by malware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removes certain non-default browser settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optional, Advanced Step (only run if previous tools fail to solve problem):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Run Sophos&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""http://get.hitmanpro.com/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HitmanPro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/oT7CjuN.png""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is HitmanPro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HitmanPro is a phenomenal &amp;quot;second-opinion&amp;quot; malware scanner. I recommend clicking &amp;quot;Settings&amp;quot; and uncheck &amp;quot;Scan for tracking cookies&amp;quot; before starting the scan. This will drastically reduce scan times. This tool can only be run ONCE for free. Use it wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;/strong&gt; If malware has prohibited you from browsing the web or downloading files, you can try running the &lt;a href=""http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/netadapter-repair-all-in-one/""&gt;NetAdapter Repair Tool&lt;/a&gt;  with &lt;a href=""http://i.imgur.com/XLv1ZUW.png""&gt;all options checked&lt;/a&gt; which will attempt to restore your internet connection &amp;amp; default browser settings. You may have to download these tools on another computer and move them to a flash drive that you can plug into the infected machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think your Mac is infected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try &lt;a href=""https://www.malwarebytes.com/mac/""&gt;Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for Mac&lt;/a&gt;. Please make a post if it is unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have run all of the above tools successfully, you should be malware-free. If you are still experiencing problems, please make a post in &lt;a href=""/r/techsupport""&gt;/r/techsupport&lt;/a&gt; for further assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow-up Steps (highly recommended):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a computer that has not been infected, change passwords to all your online accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider enabling two-factor authentication on all accounts!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install a better anti-virus. See recommendations below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is malware?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware""&gt;Malware&lt;/a&gt; is an umbrella term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software, including computer viruses, worms, trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, scareware, and other malicious programs. It can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software. [Source: Wikipedia.com]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did I get infected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to track down the source of an infection. Most infections are actually given permission to run unknowingly by the user. It is recommended to keep User Account Control turned on and never give access to something you do not trust or did not open. Many other infections come via exploits in your browser or browser plug-ins on websites you visit. Always be very careful what you install. Make sure you trust the source implicitly. When downloading programs, always use the publisher’s website directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to prevent future infections:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be very careful what you download and install. Keep your software up-to-date. Using &lt;a href=""http://ninite.com""&gt;Ninite&lt;/a&gt; for installing/updating software is very easy &amp;amp; safe and uses official installers without adding extra software to your PC during installation. Make sure Windows is kept up-to-date as well, including Windows 10 feature updates. Many Windows updates patch exploits and vulnerabilities in your operating system. Most infections are active because the user has unknowingly given it Administrative permission to install and run. The first line of defense starts with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The following tools will aide you in keeping your computer clean:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free Anti-Virus Suggestions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/thankyou/""&gt;Malwarebytes 4.0&lt;/a&gt; (Next-generation anti-virus replacement, free version must be run MANUALLY)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/free.html""&gt;BitDefender&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/""&gt;ESET Free Online Scanner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free AVs will only go so far. I highly recommend purchasing the AV of your choice to get better protection. Companies who offer products for free are usually making money off you one way or another. This has been &lt;a href=""https://www.cnet.com/news/antivirus-firm-avast-is-reportedly-selling-users-web-browsing-data/""&gt;proven again recently with Avast&lt;/a&gt;. If you use Avast, uninstall it immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helpful Tools:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

,techsupport,"Hi,

Last night I was working on my PC and turned it off. Today when I tried to turn it on I got no signal, no post or nothing.

I think the problem might be the motherboard (Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E), because the LEDs stopped working a while ago, and some weeks ago I noticed some of the RAM slots are not working. But I'm not sure how to confirm it.

To test what might be faulty I started disconnecting components from the MB to see if after disconnecting something I might get some kind of signal on the monitor, so right now the motherboard it's just connected with the CPU, front chassis fans and PSU and still no signal.

Also while disconnecting components I noticed my CPU cooling and CPU look like this but I don't know if that's normal:
