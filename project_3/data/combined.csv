" Hi there,  


Looking for some help with my Alienware 17 R4, getting hopeless. Although I've made slight improvements with things like changing options in bios, throttlestop disabling BD PROCHOT, undervolting, changing power management percentage, monitoring temps and usuage using mwinfo etc etc etc. So It appears when I clock my 2.8ghz to 3.5-3.6ghz I get the same performance in HEAVEN benchmark as when it's at 2.8, except my temps get up to over 90 degrees celcius. So that's why I put my power management down to 85-90%, and my temps remain in the 80s, and my performance is very similar.  


I don't quite seem to be getting the same performance I use to be getting while gaming (warzone and pubg).  


Just today I ran LatencyMon and noticed I Was getting some really high numbers, so I disabled a couple dell drivers and seen the battery ACPI was giving me high numbers so I disabled that. That seemed to improve performance slightly, but doing all this seems like its just a bandage to my situation and I'm not resolving the root cause. Considering I use to get much better performance, I'm not sure what it could be.  


My 17 R4 specs are as followed;  
AMD Radeon(TM) RX 570 with 8GB GDDR5

Well, I removed my storage devices and I was still getting that screen, so I figured I'd remove the ram and put it back to see if that did anything. Now when I boot, the onboard LEDs on the mobo can't get past the first yellow DRAM light, and I get no screen at all. Thoughts?

- G.SKILL Ripjaws DDR4-3600 8gbx2

EDIT: I tried to boot with only one of the ram sticks at a time in the recommended slot. For one of the sticks, I got stuck at the DRAM led and saw no signal detected on the screen, for the other stick, I got that purple screen again. I'm guessing the ram is the problem?

EDIT 2: I tried it again because I wasn't convinced I had the ram properly seated and both sticks of ram seem to be giving that purple screen now.

"I have a Frankenstein PC made up of whatever I got cheaply over the last 10 years or so.  So it's not really surprising it has issues.  But I thought I'd see if anyone has a recommendation, aside from just, ""buy a new one."" :D

A friend of mine was getting rid of his GeForce GTX 760, so I recently stuck that in.  It's taking a lot more power than my previous GTX 650Ti.  That brought me up to just meet the minimum requirements to play ""Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.""  So I downloaded that and have been trying to play it.  But the whole computer shuts off once the game starts at 1080p.  I turned down the resolution a bit to 900p, and was able to play the first level until the boss.  Once the boss appeared it blinked off again.

Other intensive games don't work either, I can't even get to the main menu of Overload for some reason.  But Tempest 4000 works.

When it turns off I can't turn it immediately back on.  I have to pull the plug and wait a few seconds.  According to Open Hardware Monitor, all the temperatures on the board are fine. (There doesn't seem to be a power supply sensor).

The power supply should be enough to handle the load according to [https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator](https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator) anyway.  It's a 600W supply, but it's quite old.  Probably purchased in late 2011.  The fan seems to be running fine though, and it isn't noticeably hot.

So I'm guessing power supply issue?  Anyone have other ideas?

"I recently built a new PC, and it is working great, for the most part. However, under full load, it has completely crashed more than once, just instantly losing all power and needing to be started again. Games etc are fine!

The way I can most easily replicate it is 1) using folding at home to get to full GPU load, 2) using firefox to do something like watch a youtube video, and 3) start Davinci Resolve, hitting the CPU. If I do all of that at once (typically by accident as it's an edge case) it will likely all go black and silent. I did also have it crash like this once in the middle of editing a video. I have NOT experienced any issues when not running Davinci Resolve.

NOTHING is overclocked (yet) and XMP is disabled (for the moment)

Is this possibly a driver issue, or is it a power issue? I thought a good 750W PSU would be plenty for the 3070, but this really feels like a PSU problem..... but that is surprising to me. Everything should be up to date within a few weeks as far as drivers. I would blame Davinci, but the crashing to off instead of just a software crash is confusing.

Heya everyone, a month or two ago i finally built my first gaming PC, and it has been working great (until now)

So far I have restarted, shut down, and booted in safe mode. None of which have worked. I also reset windows and reinstalled it locally on my PC and i selected “keep personal files” when I did that, so I could select the “delete files” button and download windows a second time but it would be a pain to reinstall all my games (but i’m ok with doing that if it gets my machine to work).

I’m pretty confident it is not a hardware related issue but rather a software one as all of my parts have their lights on and fans spinning, as well as my ability to move my mouse cursor and press control+alt+del to enter the lock screen again while in that black screen.

Sorry for the wordiness, but does anyone have a solution?",power outage past window login dr forcefully shut power outage house login window turning approached black screen mouse cursor heya month ago finally built gaming working great far restarted shut booted safe mode worked reset window reinstalled locally selected personal file select delete file button download window second time pain reinstall game ok get machine work pretty confident hardware related software part light fan spinning ability mouse cursor press control alt del enter lock screen black screen sorry wordiness solution,1

"At a quite stable period (\~1s), frametimes spike to &gt;\*3 and stay there for a few 100ms up to 1s. Curiously it will take 10-30s after game start until this issue appears.

See image: [https://imgur.com/smTG9bt](https://imgur.com/smTG9bt) (Note: I used an old Driver for VR workarounds but problem remains with newest one.)

Limiting framerate in NVIDIAs Systempanel influences the frequency at which these spikes occure but not their duration (lower framerate -&gt; lower frequency), but lowering graphic settings does not seem to affect it.

I have had this problem for some time now (in all games), but it is usually temporarily fixed by a quick restart or endurable. Not in ""DOOM: Eternal"" though where it is there from the start and manifests in an extrem way rendering the game unplayable. This issue still remains on a completly new and clean Windows 10 System.

Also the first DOOM (2016) ran smoothly a couple of months ago but has now the same issues even on older drivers.

4) I cleared the CMOS - Exact same issues happen again

"Just recently built my pc with a Ryzen 7  3700x, RTX 2080 S, 16Gb  of ram, b550 Mobo, it’s a powerful computer you  get the idea. Running  at 1440p at 144hz on an LG 27GL850

However  I’ve noticed  I get these microstutters/ FPS lags across all my games, no matter if it’s a  game like COD, Squad, Rust or a less demanding game like rouge company  or some RTS titles. I will be playing at 100+fps and every few minutes my FPS drops down to 10-20fps and even single digits for 3-4 seconds. It's really starting to bother me because a pc like this should not be struggling.

Checked  my  Nvidia driver and I have the most recent, my temps are fine I monitor them with HWinfo, no overheating. My GPU dosesn't break 70 Degrees C even while gaming for hours. I have all Win10 updates so everything seems to be squared away. I went a good  period of time with no stutters but now all of a sudden its become an issue. Just annoying dropping from 100+ to 10-20fps for a few seconds in games. And  it's consistent too. What could be causing this issue all of a sudden?


SOLVED EDIT: So based on others who experienced the same issue it was found that I too had my background/wallpaper rotation set to “every minute”. The issue was that every time the wallpaper changed, I suffered a FPS lag. This was confirmed after a little test where the time interval between each FPS drop was about 60 seconds which lined up with the change in wallpapers. I changed my wallpaper rotation to once a day and now I am NOT experiencing consistent FPS drops. Thank you guys!!!

"I built my first pc about two months ago and there haven't really been any issues besides this one. It happened when I was using the painting software Krita, everything was normal but then my mouse moved incredibly slow and the music I was listening to sounded really choppy and glitchy. I shut down my computer but all the clicks were glitchy and slow. After that there weren't any problems but then a couple weeks after the same thing happened with Krita again, this time as everything was becoming really slow I checked the software Core Temp to see my CPU temps and it was about 70 C and going down, not too good but no where near high enough to throttle. Same thing happened, everything slowed down and was unresponsive with the sound becoming all choppy. I looked into it and other Krita users said to turn off OpenGL which would stop it from using the graphics card, after that there was no issues with Krita.

That was until now, another few weeks later. I was playing minecraft and had in a VC on discord. Same thing happened, my fps dropped, sound started messing up too, and things started to become slow or unresponsive. I reset my pc then turned it off. I opened it up, cleaned out the dust, unplugged and replugged my graphics card, unplugged the graphics card wire and replugged in into the power supply, checked the other wires to see if they were in tight enough and they were. Both my CPU and GPU temps are no where near high enough to throttle after it, not to mention minecraft didn't enough use enough GPU power to turn the fans on. 

I have no idea what this issue is, maybe a MOBO or power supply thing? Maybe just my monitor being faulty? Not to mention that games requiring more resources like DMC5, Dark Souls 3, or Yakuza 0 have never had any of these issues, but programs like Kirta and Minecraft which aren't graphic intensive in the slightest are the only ones causing something. Also I was in VC the entire time the last time it happened and my friends said I didn't sound chpoppy or laggy when it happened, so if it was a CPU, GPU, or even MOBO problem I should've cut out right?

"Yet another one of these threads. I am not able to get any signal through either of my display ports on my 2060 Super (SC Black)

Some quick system info:
MOBO Asus Prime Z390-A
CPU Intel® Core™ i7-9700K CPU @ 3.60GHz
GPU EVGA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER (Part number: 08G-P4-3062-RX.)
RAM 2x8 Corsair Vengeance
Windows 10 Home (64Bit) on a 970 Evo.

So I was finally able to finish my build last week. I decided to test out my Oculus Rift S and was confused why it was not connecting through either of my display ports ( I use HDMI for my monitor so never checked my DPs when I first received the card) My first theory is that it was the shitty Oculus software / the headset itself. So I took my Rift S to a buddies place and it worked instantly.

After getting back to my place I then tried using display port for my monitor and found out that wasn't getting any signal at all. I've browsed these forums and came across multiple articles just like these but none of the ""fixes"" that are offered seem to help.

I am begging to think both display ports on the card are faulty/stopped working. I looked into VBIOS updates but there is no updated software for the card anywhere. I've also adjusted multiple power settings, re-seated the GPU itself and fully removed all software via DDU. I've contacted EVGA and have had no response.

I hate being the person to ask for help on this and add another article to these forums but I have been at this for two days and have found nothing that will help.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

"Thought I’d treat myself to an SSD to put my OS on this Black Friday. It arrived and I formatted the drive using my old OS on my old hard drive. Disconnected my old HDD and used a USB to install the latest version of windows on the SSD. So far so good. The SSD ran fine, used it for an hour or so with the HDD still detached just to test it. Then I turned off all the power, waited and reconnected the hard drive. Turned on my computer, booted into the BIOS and selected the SSD as my boot option. Windows logo was showing loading and then...black. Connection to my monitor has gone. I tried rebooting from just my HDD with no SSD attached and same thing. Figured out it was my display drivers by uninstalling them in safe mode. But now I cannot physically get my graphics card drivers to reinstall. Midway through the install process, no matter what driver version I use or if I clear it completely with DDU in safe mode first, it will crash and then eventually turn off my PC with no output to the monitor. There is no way it was damage to the GPU as I was extremely careful to disconnect power supplies and not interfere with any connectors while working.

"Before anything else, I reinstalled this pump back onto the original Asus X99 motherboard it came off and it functions properly on that motherboard. Pump failure is not my issue and I took the time to verify that the pump does in fact still work. I borrowed another Corsair H115i AIO from a friend, installed it and it also does not operate on the MSI mobo, but works properly on the ASUS X99 mobo.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I know this is a long post but I want to put up all the info I have to avoid suggestions I've already implemented. I appreciate any help offered as I've run out of ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a new build, and Windows is not yet installed. The system posts properly and I can enter BIOS. All case fans operate properly and as the CPU temps rise the case fans are all ramping up as they are supposed to. Only the AIO pump does not operate as it should.

&amp;#x200B;

The cooler is a Corsair H110i GTX. It's old, I know, but it looks good with the new parts and more importantly it still does a good job with no air bubble noise. I would prefer not to replace it if I can avoid it. The cost isn't my concern, rather the quality of newer AIOs I've looked at is much lower and they all look pretty awful, hence my decision to try to reuse this one.

&amp;#x200B;

The cooler has 4 leads. The USB lead I have plugged into JUSB1 header. The Sata power lead is plugged into the PSU through a SATA power cable. The fan lead splits to run the radiator's two 140mm fans. The single wire ending in a 3-pin plug is connected to the CPU\_Fan\_1 header.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the same way I installed it on my previous X99 mobo. But my results are not the same on the MSI motherboard and I can't seem to figure out why.

&amp;#x200B;

* The Corsair logo illuminates properly. 
* The radiator fans both activate properly.
* The pump does not activate.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately without the pump I have a limited time to fart around in the MSI bios which I am very unfamiliar with. I'd also prefer not not run the CPU at 100C while fumbling around. Of course since there is a ticking clock as soon as I turn on the PC my IQ is reduced by half and I lose my ability to control a mouse because reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

What I have already managed to try based on local suggestions:

* Connect a regular fan to CPU\_Fan\_1 to see if a fan runs off that header. Fan operates properly, header is not faulty.
* Connect the AIO pump 3-pin lead to the PUMP\_FAN1 header. No change, PUMP\_FAN1 header will also operate a fan properly and is not faulty.
* Connect the AIO pump 3-pin lead to a SYS\_FAN lead. No change.
* Connect the AIO pump 3-pin lead to the PSU directly using a molex to 3-pin adapter. No change, using voltage tester direct power from the Molex plug is not 12V. I believe the pump needs a 12V signal. 
* In BIOS switch fan from PWM to DC. I have done this but unlike the BIOS in my previous PC there is no ""apply"" button so I'm not sure the changes I'm making are even taking effect.
* Allow the CPU to reach higher temps to see if the pump kicks in at higher temps - Eventually I get a message that the CPU is overheating and the PC shuts down. I would prefer not to have that happen again and would prefer not to even attempt another similar strategy.
* In BIOS switch the voltage manually to 12V. I've entered BIOS several times and as I am unfamiliar with the MSI BIOS have not found how/where to do this. The CPU temps start climbing over 90C and I have to shut down.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on about 6 hours of reading last night, I'm thinking the AIO waterpump needs a 12V signal to activate and is not getting a full 12V signal. The waterpump should be running 100% at all times unlike the fans and requires a simple 12V signal to activate. The mobo does not support my ancient AIO because it doesn't use the current standard AIO  hookup. As the signal cable connected to CPU\_FAN\_1 is a single one direction signal wire , the mobo is not detecting power draw from CPU\_Fan\_1 and therefore is not sending a signal to the pump to fire up.

&amp;#x200B;

If there is not way to do this through BIOS is there something I can wire up to send a 12V signal to the pump whenever the system is on so that it comes on regardless of what the motherboard is up to?

&amp;#x200B;

Hdmi goes from my ps5 to hdmi IN on the splitter, hdmi out from the splitter goes to the elgato IN, hdmi cable goes from elgato OUT to my monitor.

Without using the elgato, the display information shows 1080p 120hz

Sometimes i play 4k games on my ps5 at 60hz and that works smooth without issues, capturing works greats.

To start from the beginning I have a gigabyte a320m s2h mobo and ryzen 3 3200G cpu, I was playing my games happily on that with decent fps, like 60 to 70 on csgo etc, and it never stuttered at all.
Fsst forward to two weeks ago I but my first gpu! Happy excited times, I install it with help from Dad and it all boots up fine make sure I install drivers and it works! 230ish fps in csgo and 100 in drg! But! It stutters every now and then it freezes up and whatever command I last inputted keeps being pressed and the display freezes?

What could be the cause?
I am using a display port to Vga adapter currently until I can afford a new monitor so that was one thought, I'm also using a 350W psu which according to pc part picker is right on the limit for what my pc needs if I did maths right.

Hey all,

So I noticed this issue a few days ago and can’t seem to figure it out. When playing on my PC there seems to be this issue where there is this very faint stuttering randomly. It’s most noticeable in Destiny 2 when looks around. It’s very faint and frame rate doesn’t drop when it happens. I’m also scoring very low on user benchmark. 16 to 18 percent in graphics. I have tried running games as admin. Turning windows game recording off. Used DDU to uninstall all drivers and reinstall. I’ve tried messing with just about every game setting. My GPU isn’t overheating at all according to MSI afterburner. I’ve ran Kombuster and it holds up fine. Any ideas of what to do?

"Hi everyone!

I know there have been plenty of posts on this general topic, but even through doing my due diligence I feel like I can't get a clear answer given my particular rig and scenario. 

Basically, please with some basic logic behind it, help me understand if and how high I need to be capping my FPS and why that will benefit me. 


**Relevant Parts of My Setup:**

Intel Core i7-10700 

MSI Z490 Motherboard

2080 Super 8 GB 

Dell S2719DGF 27.0"" 1440p, 144hz, freesync NOT gsync Monitor

**My current conclusion:** 

Since I have a 144hz freesync monitor, and a 2080 super + high end CPU, I should be able to push 144 fine in most competitive fps with settings on low. My main goal is max &amp; most *consistent* framerate. So, I use NVIDIA control panel to hard cap my output at 143fps. I leave framerate in-game uncapped if possible, or as high as custom will go. V-sync off, freesync on. This should allow the game to pump as many frames as possible while hard capping ensures my monitor stays at just below the max refresh rate for most conistency in framerate. 

However, I'm not sure that capping my fps seems to have made things FEEL smoother. But I do feel like I notice less drops? I'm just unsure and that's why I want an actual concrete understanding.

Should I cap it in some games and not others? If I can or cannot push 144? For instance, I have no problem pushing 144 in most games, if not well over that. Like valorant, rocket league, other well optimised games etc. But I can get 144 MAYBE on a good day with drops to lower hundreds in Apex and Warzone.

"Hi guys,

For the context, I bought a new laptop right before the lockdown got announced, so I didn’t use it that much for the last 6 months (it has 16 days worked in total). 

The problem is that sometimes some artifacts appear on the screen for a fraction af a second.
Tbh there were more frequent artifacts on the screen before checking all the right drivers. However, even now I get some small artifacts. 

What can I do to troubleshoot the problem and maybe give it back to the store to fix it (if I can’t)?

"Hi guys, since yesterday i have a strange problem with my gpu fans. While i was gaming, my rx 480 fans started pumping at max speed for extended periods of time. I checked gpu temps and they never went above 68 ° C. The fans spun even after closing the game, with my gpu hovering around 40°C. Only after like 2 minutes they went quiet again. What's worse is that now my fans start spinning at max speed as soon as i boot the pc and they don't stop. I hope that my fan controller didn't blow up or something. 

Of course, i have no kind of overclocking going on, both my cpu and gpu are at stock speeds. The problem was there both with manual fan control from radeon app and default settings applied. Also another thing to note is that right now Radeon app doesn't show my gpu fans rpm. It says that they are stuck at 0 rpm which is of course not true at all since they are going at full speed. I don't use msi afterburner, the only external monitoring programm that i have is hwmonitor, which i unistalled to see if it was affecting something. A thing to note is that hwmonitor didn't show my gpu fan speed (something that always did normally) which adds to the Radeon app showing me the 0 rpm thing.

.undervolted the card and fiddled with the power limit 

. Reinstalled windows twice. 

.Checked psu cables - fyi it's a 750w evga supernova PSU - so I doubt its a power delivery issue on that end.

 Okay so I moved back to my dads from college. I can only rely on their  wifi connection. Problem is that games lag so bad sometimes because my  ping sometimes jumps up. I can't really use an ethernet cable because  they wouldn't want a long cable lying around. Is there any wireless  device or anything that I can invest in that would make my ping better  for gaming and potentially streaming?

My issue is that whenever I try to launch an application-usually a game-I experience some sort of issue, with varying problems. Some examples:

Launching Overwatch will cause my computer to constantly dip to 10-20fps and stutter for about 5 minutes, then afterwards my computer plays the game like normal. My color settings in NVIDIA control panel also are automatically changed every time.

Launching Borderlands 3 will give some minor stutters and dips in FPS, however when tabbing into Epic Games, my computer can sometimes become unresponsive for a few seconds at a time. Will act normally when tabbed back into the game.

\-

I feel like I have exhausted just about all of my options. I have tried running games at different resolutions, changing the resolution in Windows, turning HDR on and off, uninstalling and reinstalling the games that had given me issue, running hardware scans, yet nothing really seems to make any noticeable difference in performance. My only other thought is that it's maybe some sort of bottleneck? I know the 2070 isn't really meant for 4k gaming, and aside from some smaller, less demanding titles, I'm still setting my games at 1080p or 1440p. The other thing that has me completely confused is that there's a lot of titles or applications that have no issues whatsoever, even when ran in 4k HDR, which makes me think that it's not a hardware issue. But I could be wrong.

I've just been extremely frustrated, as I've put a lot of money into this rig, only for it to barely work at times, even though it's got some quality parts in there. And while I mentioned my suspicion of it possibly being a bottleneck, I don't want to shell out over a grand on an Ampere card, only for that to not be the issue and still be in the same situation that I'm in now. So if anybody has any ideas as to what my issue would be, I would greatly appreciate it.

This is so frustrating because literally yesterday it didn't have this problem and worked perfectly, but it had another issue so I had to reinstall the game on my steam. Now that I've reinstalled it the other issue is gone but now I have this controller issue.

"Ok, i'll get straight to the point, that being, i need a GPU upgrade, it's pretty bad, with me having a GTX 960 OC from 6 years ago, and i was planning on upgrading this Christmas (I am looking for an NVIDIA GPU and not AMD, because i want the sweet DLSS, Ray Tracing and to be compatible to my G-SYNC monitor). My budget is around 620$ MAX. When i heard the news abut the RTX 3070 back a month ago, i thought of it as a no brainer, 500$ for an RTX 2080Ti is pretty good, but the situation is pretty bad right now, the lowest priced 3070 in stock being around 900$, which makes me quite sad tbh because it's just straight up bullshit, hyping everyone up for the 3000 series and then making bicycles instead of GPUS.

Long story short - is it worth getting something now, like a 2070 (normal 2080s are in stock, but are 1100$ in my country KEKW)  or waiting... i estimate around 4 months for prices to cool, and get a 3070?

Any other GPU suggestions are welcome! Oh and one more thing, if i have the latest NVIDIA game drivers installed, will i need to install additional drivers if i change my GPU? Thanks!

The PC never fully restarted and the screen never came back on (no post, no ROG logo, no Windows logo) although the RGB is going as usual along with fans spinning. The board is getting power but something is up with the CPU initializing thus preventing a full startup.

With the release of the newest call of duty, I’ve switched over to PC for this one. The group I play with is still on PS4/5, which leaves us the communication barrier. Now, we don’t like using game chat AT ALL, so we’ve resorted to me joining the voice chats on my phone (PS App) and running smaller headphones under my PC Gaming ones. I’m looking for a way to ONLY use on headset for both the output of the PC game, output of the PS App voice chat, AND the input to the PS App voice chat.

I’ve thought of a few ways this could be done but I have zero knowledge in these fields. Bare with me as I try to explain what I envision here.

What I’m picturing would be splitting the iPhone PS App audio to headphone and mic with a splitter. Taking the headphone portion and either a) feeding it into the pc as an input device and having “listen to device” on so I can always here it or b) purchasing an Audio Mixer with a 3.5mm jack. Using the audio mixer, I’d feed in the PS App output along with the PC game output which would end up running into my headphones (my headphones are already split for headphone/mic at the end) then simply plugging my headphone mic to the iPhone input.

If anyone has any knowledge in this field, has done something like this before, or could tell me I’m crazy, feel free! I’m just tired of using iPhone headphones under my over the ear headphones just to talk to people since the PS App isn’t available on PC.

Thanks!",audio mixing playstation app audio mixing goodmorning weird concept know possible go release newest duty switched group play ps4 5 leaf communication barrier using game chat resorted joining voice chat phone p app running smaller headphone gaming one looking way use headset output game output p app voice chat input p app voice chat thought way zero knowledge field bare try explain envision picturing splitting iphone p app audio headphone mic splitter taking headphone portion feeding input device listen device b purchasing audio mixer 3 5mm jack using audio mixer feed p app output game output end running headphone headphone split headphone mic end simply plugging headphone mic iphone input knowledge field tell crazy feel free tired using iphone headphone ear headphone talk people p app available thanks,1

I have had problems since I got this laptop about 4-5 months ago. There are 2 main problems, but the only one I care about today is the FPS. 

In multiple games, including Far Cry New Dawn, Sunautica, Sea of Thieves, and more, my FPS has very noticeable peaks and valleys. In other games, like Far Cry Blood Dragon, Assassins Creed Origins, and Apex Legends, my FPS is just unplayably low (around 20 fps at the lowest settings, but around 40 in Apex; apex is not unplayable, I actually play it often, its just very annoying) In the first games mentioned, for a couple of seconds, I will get insanely smooth FPS, then it will dip to a disgusting stutter for about the same amount of time, before it goes back up, then down again, and so on. My Nvidia FPS overlay has not worked for a couple of months now, but from what I remember Far Cry New Dawn will bounce from 80ish fps down to 20ish. In that game specifically, changing graphics settings to the minimum will make it go from 90 to 25 FPS instead, but the peaks and valleys did not go away. Turing off Game Bar background recording changed nothing, and turning off windows game mode DID eliminate the peaks and valleys in Subnautica, but the game just consistently stayed at the lowest FPS. I used to think this was a GPU issue, because when I took it to a computer repair shop to fix the issues I will talk about in the next paragraph, they said there could be a faulty GPU in the system. Later, I began to think it was a RAM problem, so I upgraded to 16GB, which did slightly increase FPS in Apex, but it didn't seem to do much more.

The other problem, which I have learned to accept, and I am only listing in case it is relevant to the other issue, is with the Microsoft store. (keep in mind that all of the issues above were happening while this was happening, I just had very few games installed at this time and I cared more about this) The problem is that games will open once or twice, then never again. Even after reinstalls, the game would simply just never open again. It has been a long time, but I remember the file shortcut icons on my desktop disappearing as well. In an attempt to fix this, Microsoft support gave me a specific unlisted windows update to install, this did not fix the issue. Later I would find out this very stupid Microsoft employee gave me an update that was incompatible with my system, with caused a HOST of other issues, including the start menu not opening, and the search bar not working. I could only open apps through file manager. I took my laptop to a computer repair shop to fix the issues with the start menu, as I was not aware that the update wasn't compatible. I told them about the Microsoft store issues as well, and when I came back to get my laptop, they told me about the update, and that they think the Microsoft store problem has something to do with a faulty GPU. I told Dell support, as hardware issues are covered under their warranty, and they did a test that took only about 5 minutes, told me my hardware was fine, and that I would need to pay $100 dollars to get their advanced software support. I did that, and they factory reset my laptop. The only thing the factory reset fixed was the start menu issues, and everything else persists today. (Quick side note about the GPU issues, for a couple of days \[about a week before the factory reset\], I got random errors that said something about my GPU being incompatible, then they went away, and I have not gotten such an error since.) These events took place 4ish months ago. 

One more note about the games with low FPS. My laptop has an Nvidia 1660ti Mobile. My friend (with whom I play PC games wth very often) has a laptop with around the same specs as me, except he has an RTX 2060 mobile. His GPU SHOULD be only marginally better, (20ish percent) except his laptop has none of the issues I have, and he is getting around 100 FPS in Apex on high settings. He is also getting consistently high FPS in Subnautica, but I don't know his specific FPS in that game.

And ONE more quick thing. All GPU benchmarks I have done match up exactly how they should between me and my friend, his being slightly better than mine. But he isn't having the issues I am.

RAM: HyperX FURY (2 x 8 GB) 2666MHz DDR4 (the same  type as already in my PC so its now 4 of the same make, size and MHz)

I Then installed my RAM after I was sure my  new SSD worked as well, and had sorted out boot options so I can later add my old HHD for extra space if needed.

This is were the real issues began for me, and I can't seem to shift them despite all the advice I have  found.

**The Issues**

i have  a few issues. 

firstly, my pc sometimes  starts covered in horizontal white lines, i will link a picture  below of a good representation. [White Lines](https://i.imgur.com/J9QBA11.jpg)

Secondly when it doesnt  have  the white lines after restarting a couple of times, in device manager my GPU always   has an warning [symbol](https://imgur.com/XVOBq1q)

on clicking on  that warning symbol I am told I have an error code,  [Code 43](https://imgur.com/RRCeEg3).
I cannot seem to fix this despite uninstalling, reinstalling driver, updating it, troubleshoot does nothing for me and there is no roll-back option. i have also followed common fix videos for it.

Thinking my issue may have been physically the GPU I unplugged and  dusted the card before plugging it back in making sure all cables are attached firmly in case adding the RAM I had knocked it loose.

Lastly I had been playing PC games before and after the RAM was installed to check out the new speed differences and it all seemed fine for a  day or so before the next day I   went to boot  a  game and was offered this error as well. [DX11 feature level 10.0](https://imgur.com/fl8QvLc) which I had no idea about, it may have been their before but i  doubt it as the games i had tested before, while still running, can not launch properly and lag even on menus where as before it didn't have an issue.

I assume its my PC not using my GPU and using the onboard available.

I've been having this problem for 3 days now. I've tried almost everything to solve it but doesn't seem to work.

Things that I've tried

Resetting my pc  
Clean install of drivers  
Using UDD to uninstall the drivers and then downloading them with no internet.  
Cleaning my graphics card  
Using a different motherboard  
Different versions of windows  
Different versions of NVIDIA drivers Standard and DCH drivers

I don't think is a hardware problem since the card performs fine under a stress test but who knows it could still be the card.

Problem in more detail: When I install the drivers it just gives me a black screen at by the beginning of the installation, I've tried disconnecting the monitor and plugging it back it but it doesn't seem to work and I've also tried to use different display port cables. After that I have to force shutdown my computer, then try to boot into windows again but now it gives me a black screen at boot. Then I have to go into safe mode and uninstall all graphics drivers in order to boot into windows.

"This entire build is new as of 4 months ago but the entire time I've had it, I've had this one issue which I've tried so hard to fix but just can't.

Every 3 or 4 times the system is turned on, everything boots up as expected except the red debug light for the boot drive on my motherboard stays on. Whenever this happens, I can't write to my drive at higher than 10KB/s making it impossible to download anything. A system restart will fix this issue for a few days but it'll always return. 

Multiple times, the GPU light has also been lit even though that seems to be operating just fine.

I've tried changing different BIOS settings and checking connections but the problem still persists and it's driving me mad! If you have any thoughts on how I could I could fix this I'd be extremely grateful for some help.

"Hi guys, I've noticed that my game's video suddenly freeze for 1 to 3 seconds when playing. It's kinda annoying, specially on competitive games like CS:GO and I feel there's no reason this should go on. Any ideas on what it would be? (Happens on PAYDAY 2 too). Let's say I'm playing for around 3 minutes and then freezes on a single frame for 3 seconds and keeps on running. The GPU when limited could run at 50% and still freeze. The CPU never goes above 40% usage. so I know it's not a thermal throttling issue. I am thinking it could be a hardware problem with the graphics card but idk.

Specs: 3600x, 3070, 32gb ram, yada yada :)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I have a hyperx cloud stinger headset, and when I use it to play call of duty, it's a little quiet. The thing is, at full volume of everything (the litter slider on the side of the headset, my volume mixer, sound settings &gt; master volume, call of duty settings volume... Everything is on 100. It's not SO quiet that I can't hear anything, but I prefer gaming loud, but even for regular standards and someone who doesn't want explosions to break their ears, it's still kind of quiet, meh at best. Some people online were saying things like ""you just have a cheap headset"", so I go and buy an Astro A40, and same problem  


So now I know, it's gotta be something about the pc. I'm thinking I might be missing some drivers? I have the realtek audio drivers that you install with the mobo, is there anything else I need? My case is the Silverstone FARA R1, could this case be the problem somehow? Could it be a loose connection to be mobo? I've tried both the 3 ring single aux cable at the front, as well as the dual 3.5mm jacks at the back, no dice  


If someone could help I'd really appreciate it, I've looked everywhere :(

"I am unsure whether it was the overclock I did to my cpu or if my MOBO has shorted. This is the second computer I have built and I am not even finished with it yet, I am just using an old cpu &amp; graphics card till I can get my hands on the new ryzen 5000 cpu and 6000 gpu. Specs are as follows:

MOBO: Asus Crosshair VIII Hero
Ram: Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 64 gb 4 sticks
Storage: Samsung 970 evo Pro 2tb
PSU: be quiet Straight Power 11 850w gold+

I noticed a major frame drop when using my 3200g CPU, which I bought due to MOBO compatibility problems with 1600, compared to my Ryzen 5 1600. So since my MOBO was made for overclocking I decided that I might as well try it out. I pressed the automatic overclock in the bios because I have no clue how to overclock a CPU and it set the frequency to 4.1 GHz. I have left it there for about a month with no problems. Suddenly I encountered the problem but quickly fixed it by reseatting the ram. However I soon started having other issues with the ram where ICUE would not read them properly and what not these were also fixed but now my computer refuses to turn. I have reseated the ram muliple times, checked for loose screws, unplugged the GPU to see if it was taking up too much power, and checked the connections multiple times. Nothing has worked.

"So I know it’s a tough question to answer because there are so many graphical options that can be tweaked on a PC for optimal performance.  But a buddy of mine who is an avid console gamer asked me a fair question. 

As we talked and I was trying to convince him of why he should take a run at PC gaming he was under the impression that every time you play a game on a PC before you could play it that you would need to optimize it. 

I explained this could be true in some instances and I went on to explain why.  He then asked me if there were preset settings.  And I answered almost in every game that I have seen there are preset settings. 

His follow up question to me was this
“So if he was playing Avengers on the PC what would the PRESET setting be that would closely resemble Xbox series X or a PS5. “

I answered him in my opinion that it was the Normal setting or Medium. I’m just curious as if anyone has differing opinions or can shine some light on our discussion either way.",preset graphical setting similar home console know tough question answer graphical option tweaked optimal performance buddy avid console gamer asked fair question talked trying convince run gaming impression time play game play need optimize explained true instance went explain asked preset setting answered game seen preset setting follow question playing avenger preset setting closely resemble xbox series x ps5 answered opinion normal setting medium curious differing opinion shine light discussion way,1
"There are a few layers to this so please bear with me.

I put everything together watching build tutorials online and thoroughly reading the manuals that came with the parts and everything more or less went smoothly, but when I went to turn on the power button nothing happened. (Yes the psu was switched on) 

None of the 3 fans spin, no lights light up on the case. The motherboard’s rog logo lit up but nothing else showed signs of life. On top of that there is a solid red light that shows up on the top left of the mobo, but of the other lights indicate component errors.

I have now unplugged everything and reseated the front IO panel (making sure the positive and negative pins were connected properly), as well as the ram and one EPS 4+4 pin connector and the 20 pin connector for the motherboard and nothing has changed. I’m not sure if the psu was dead on arrival or if my ram is faulty or any other 3rd scenario (I also tried powering on with only one of the two ram sticks installed twice and nothing happened). 

So where do I go from here? I’m not sure how to test the psu for any faults and I don’t have any spare compatible parts to swap out. Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you. [photos for reference ](https://imgur.com/gallery/oFD4F6N)

"I have been using my Xbox One controller on my PC for about 6 months without issue. But starting last week I have an incredibly weird issue. When I hold the left joystick to the right, and repeatedly press the A button very fast, it will eventually start the windows narrator and say ""Make your computer easier to use..."".

If I hold the left joystick to the right and press the A button slowly or at a medium speed, it doesn't happen. If I press the A button very fast without the joystick, it doesn't happen. If I hold any other direction on the joystick and press A button very fast, it doesn't happen.

I have narrator disabled on my PC through Ease of Access, but somehow this still triggers and it starts talking. This happens on the desktop, in game, anywhere. Happens immediately after a restart if the first thing I do is turn on the controller and do the combo.

Hi guys. I bought my first custom built PC in 2018 and so far I have sent it back twice for the same issue. I'll have the PC running and it doesn't matter if it is in a game or just on the desktop. It'll lose power and boot back on randomly. Both times I have sent it down it hadn't showed this fault. So far it's been moved to another case and had the ram replaced. The PC worked fine for a few months before the error returned. Just wondering if anyone had had anything similar happen before I have tried removing the graphics card and all other input like keyboards Incase they might be the issue. I have even tried different power outlets. Sometimes it'll shut off in less than 5 mins.

"First the problem. I have had more than my fair share of problems with Fallout 4, modding it has obviously caused a series of performance issues. But every time I've f'd it up, I've managed to figure out the problem and fix it. Quite recently the performance issues have seemed to get worse, namely lag and occasional freezes. I initially thought this had to be mod nonsense, but now I'm not sure. I've been playing Dying Light on the side with zero issues aside from the occasional mini-freeze/lag. But now it also seems to have very bad lag. The lag is most prevalent the more action is going on, so I suspect hardware.

Second. The irritating benchmark: [https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/35926260](https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/35926260)Irritating because I have a gaming laptop (Acer Nitro AN515-43) with two GPU's. Despite setting it in windows power settings it won't test my discrete GPU (Radeon RX 560X), only the onboard GPU. When running the test it says: WARN: skipping Radeon RX 560X Series - unable to locate attached display.

Last considerations. Fo4 is installed on my SSD, and DL on my HDD. It's possible there are separate issues affecting both of them. But I'm sure it's not a coincidence that they both started to have the same problem at the same time. However, F04's lag is much worse despite being on much lower settings and userbench says that my HDD is underperforming. Overall though my settings don't seem to affect the performance, I have the same issue on both games regardless of settings. I also bought a cooling pad, in case the issue was throttling of some kind, but that's made no difference either.

I would like to add images of potentially useful information from afterburner, nitrosense and novabench. But it seems I cannot in this sub, but I have them ready if the info will help.

I'd really appreciate some help with figuring this problem out. What else can I do to diagnose and or try to fix the issue? Userbench says I would enable XMP for my Memory kit, should I? Could this be the problem?  Any help would be much appreciated.",help diagnose decreased performance time sudden extreme lag problem fair share problem fallout 4 modding obviously caused series performance issue time f'd managed figure problem fix quite recently performance issue worse lag occasional freeze initially thought mod nonsense sure playing dying light zero issue aside occasional mini freeze lag bad lag lag prevalent action going suspect hardware second irritating benchmark irritating gaming laptop acer nitro an515 43 gpu's despite setting window power setting test discrete gpu radeon rx 560x onboard gpu running test say warn skipping radeon rx 560x series unable locate attached display consideration fo4 installed ssd dl hdd possible separate issue affecting sure coincidence started problem time f04's lag worse despite lower setting userbench say hdd underperforming overall setting affect performance game regardless setting bought cooling pad case throttling kind difference add image potentially useful information afterburner nitrosense novabench sub ready info help really appreciate help figuring problem diagnose try fix userbench say enable xmp memory kit problem help appreciated,1

"I had a 144 hz gaming monitor, and recently I just switched to another one with 170hz and hdr support.

My Equipment: GTX 1080 Ti, i7 6700K. Both monitors are connected through DP 1.4.

The issue is: the screen will turns black for a second, whenever I open Xbox Game Bar overlay, or switch back to desktop, even when the game setting has the same resolution and refresh rate in both desktop and game.

I had this issue already with my previous gaming monitor, and turns out that even FreeSync is turned off in Nvidia Setting, once the FreeSync feature is enabled in monitor OSD Setting, this issue will happen. It was solved by turning the FreeSync off in monitor OSD.

But now it happens again with my new monitor. I have FreeSync or AdaptiveSync off in both monitor and Nvidia setting. I have HDR turned on in both monitor and windows setting, and in nvidia setting it uses ""let application decide"". This issue becomes extremely annoying while playing Forza Horizon 4. Whenever an achievement was unlocked, it went black for 3 seconds, then goes back. Also when the notification disappeared, it went black again. Not to mention enable the game bar overlay in mid game.

This happens with my MPC-BE with madVR too. I successfully setup madVR with HDR, and it can finally playback HDR content (I failed to configure EVR with HDR), but it has same issue whenever the video goes into fullscreen and leave fullscreen. Also, whenever my mouse moves above the time slides and the slide shows up, my screen will turn black too. One thing worth noting, MPC-BE can already display HDR content correctly even when NOT in fullscreen mode.

"so I have a custom desktop that I built some years ago now, its worked great up until recently and I'm stumped. Started out with just some connection issues, and occasionally I'd have to troubleshoot the sound and itd come back. Well I figured I'd get a usb wifi thing since even when my internet worked it was slow and figured that the old pci-e card was having issues. Also moved my desk and set up to other side of the room at this point, cleaned out the pc and tried setting up the usb wifi. 

This is where everything went to shit. I have no wifi connections. no matter what I do I can't even connect or see wifi connections, I can't get sound to work at all ( I use a Scarlett focusrite and studio monitor speakers but even plugging headphones directly into the desktop doesn't show anything). can't find things that should be there. 

Also a thing keeps popping up about a firewall but clicking it to turn it on doesnt work. Nothing works right. But its weird because my mouse and keyboard do (wireless mouse, wired keyboard both have been moved to other usb ports and they work on all of em, but when I plug in focusrite and the wifi thing neither of those do anything)

When I put discs in the trey they also don't come up or do anything. 

So I began troubleshooting spent the past 3 days trying various things, but to be honest I think I fucked it all up worse, at some point I got frustrated and started just deleting stuff, only to realize I also can't system restore. its like things work but nothing works... Idk how to explain. I deleted drivers I think. Idk what I did but I made it worse.

Ill try attaching pictures but I'm assuming this thing is toast. Wondering how I can fix it or start over, do I try getting a new windows disc and doing a new install? How? can I go back to windows 7 since windows 10 is all problems? Is there something in bios that can maybe make my computer find my network card and find wifi signals? Why is the audio not working ? why are other things working in usb ports but not my audio or wifi? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, kind of just bummed because I put a lot of money into this thing some time back and have upgraded things over the years, Idk why these problems started. I tried uninstalling updates , feel like I've tried everything. thanks to whoever may help

"Hello everyone, pc noob here just needing some help!

So about 2 months ago I upgraded my gpu to a Gigabyte rx 5600xt, and ever since then my pc has issues when booting up. When I turn on my pc, the windows logo pops up for about 2 seconds, then the screen freezes then goes black. I end up having to hard reset my pc about 3 or 4 times before I can get it to boot up properly. Once the pc is running, I have no issues with it. After doing some research, I've heard that the AMD Adrenaline software is causing people some issues. I previously had an RX 590 in my pc but had no issues with it. I also recently upgraded my psu thinking it was an issue with my gpu not having enough power but nothing has changed. So my question is, is the issue my gpu, software, or hardware?

"Hi,

Just a few days ago I left my PC running an online game overnight. The game is nearly two decades old and has had no issues running on PCs many many years older than this one. But suddenly it started using 20-50% of my GPU usage in task manager sometime between Nov 21-22 with a single instance of the game running. When people with very similar specs are reporting 10% max usage with multiple instances of the game running. Up until the day this issue started I haven't changed anything graphically settings wise nor installed any new drivers. AFAIK no Windows updates had been performed in the time frame. I have monitored GPU function in EVGA precision a bit and noticed some times when I leave the game on overnight and turn back on my monitors the GPU and Memory clock MHz are both stuck at fixed numbers (not sure how much this matters) but even when they aren't I'm still getting the same issues in-game.

Current troubleshooting steps I've taken:

rebooted the game and PC

ran virus and malware scans that turned up nothing

uninstalled old drivers using DDU in safemode and reinstalled newest drivers.

Completely uninstalled the game and graphic mods within the game I had installed a full week prior without issue.

Made sure to disable Link State Power Management under Advanced Power Options &gt; PCI Express

Just installed a few other more modern games to test. Tested on Dark Souls 3 and getting 50% of GPU usage in task manager as well.

Main specs are:

Windows 10 64 bit

EVGA Nvidia RTX 2070 Super

AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12-core

MSI MAG X570 Tomahawk motherboard

Dual monitor lg 27gl850-b

&amp;#x200B;

Anything else I need to include here just let me know please. Racking my brain trying to figure out what the issue is.

* Lining up my ADS shot. If I see an enemy in the distance and I ADS my crosshair doesn't lock in precisely. Its always off by a few feet/inches. I can't tell if its because my settings are too sensitive or not sensitive enough. Most prevalent in long engagements but I also whiff in close quarters.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

* I recently installed the 2060 super, which allowed me to play demanding games again. Examples:
   * Witcher 3 on 1440p/ultra settings @ 100ish fps
   * CoD:Warzone at 1440p/low settings @ 110 ish fps

&amp;#x200B;

**Issue summary**

* I noticed that after booting up, my performance would degrade over time, in a weird way. Say 30 minutes after booting the PC up, as I move my mouse, I'll start to notice that it halts normal system behavior for 100ms. If I keep using the PC, the delays would get worse.
* I looked up mouse interference and many, many people have had the issue. Some have diagnosed it as a problem with Realtek drivers, but this is only half true. If you disable Realtek drivers, the problem will go away completely (great!) but then the mic port stops working and audio processing just goes to hell in demanding games, which causes its own lag.
* I updated Realtek drivers and Razer drivers (as well as all GPU/Windows updates I could find). This does not fix the problem.
* Next, I noticed that some people said the problem was caused by the Razer devices being plugged into USB 3.0 instead of USB 2.0 ports. Weird, but I gave it a shot and made sure the devices were plugged into USB 2.0 inputs only. I did this mid-game while the interference lag was occurring, and wow, it went away (great!). I thought the issue was fixed, but then after restarting, I noticed that the problem continued to occur.
* It seemed like the solution was actually unplugging the USB peripherals and then re-plugging them in. Weirdly, that is my best solution right now. I play these games until I start to notice any interference lag between mouse / system. When it happens, I unplug my mouse and keyboard and then plug them back in, and this fixes the issue for about 1 hour, until it comes back, and I repeat the unplug/replug.

&amp;#x200B;

So that's where I am right now. I have to unplug my devices and plug them back in once an hour to fix the issue. I am not an engineer, but this seems like, maybe:

* Does unplugging the USB devices shut down a system process that has hit a memory leak? Then when I replug them in, the memory leak begins again, but it takes a long time for it to reach problematic levels for my system?
* Does unplugging the USB devices normalize some kind of electrical charge that is disrupting my PSU, motherboard, or sound processes?

&amp;#x200B;

" Please help.

Brought a PC from cyberpower (i7-9700, 16gb RAM, 2070 super). Worked perfectly until I launched Call Of Duty. A really loud, wizzing/squealing sound was coming from what seemed like the GPU. It would stop as soon as I exited out of call of duty.

I contacted tech support, sent the PC back, and my 2070 was upgraded to the new 3070. PC tested, given the OK to be sent back to me.

It arrived today, set it up, downloaded COD, and the SAME noise is still happening when COD is open. Stop as soon as it closes. Now I think it could be the PSU. I'm going to contact tech again tomorrow, but if anyone has any idea what it could be, any help would be appreciated.

I've linked to 3 videos so anyone can have a listen.

"I was given a complete PC (MEDION Erazer i72000/B734) for Christmas in 2015. It was very, very loud sometimes doing a ticking sound. Then there was a popping sound and it was running quietly again. Eventually it startet being loud again. After this happened 3 times over the years, this year I opened the PC and investigated the issue. I found a cable hanging into the GPU cooler. Every time it popped, a single rotor blade had broken. The cable hull was a little bit cut. I tied the cable away with zip ties and the PC worked fine and was far more quiet.

Later this year the PC started restarting randomly. (Yes, I saw the tip to remove single parts and look if it works to find the reason) Sometimes it completely crashed while playing games, with the CPU being at 100%, sometimes it just restarted. Sometimes I could play a game without problems, ther times I couldn't. Sometimes CPU was at 100% at it stuttered, sometimes it just crashed or restarted. Occasionally the PC had problems booting after a restart or crash. One time I resetted the PC because it did not boot all the time, but it didn't fix the issue 

First I thought the new headset was the problem (HyperX Cloud II) but the error occurred with other headsets as well and even without a headset connected.

I ran memtest to test the CPU, but there was no issue, even with 100% usage. The core temperature never reached more than 60 or 70 degrees. Now I used FurMark to test the GPU and the PC always restarted after a couple of seconds, so I think that my GPU is broken. It did not run long enough to be too hot I guess.

Am I right that the GPU is the problem? Can the power adapter be the problem too and how do I verify either one?

"So here's some clues before I go ahead and scrape this entire PC (bleh).

Right before the issue started, I had left my computer on for a few days and came back to turn on the monitor. Everything was frozen on the screen. I had tried plugging in a mouse and noticed there was no power coming to the mouse. Also the power button wasn't turning off the computer so I had to basically shut it down from the PSU.

From that point forward, turning it on results in everything turning on (mobo lights up, fans spin), and then having it shut down again (repeat). Nothing gets displayed on the monitor.

So I guess my question is, if the mobo lights up, does that mean the problem is not with the mobo or CPU or RAM? or could it easily be any of those things. And if everything lights up, does that mean it's not a problem with the PSU?

Thanks for your help.",post clue ahead scrape entire bleh right started left computer day came turn monitor frozen screen tried plugging mouse noticed power coming mouse power button turning computer basically shut psu point forward turning result turning mobo light fan spin shut repeat get displayed monitor guess question mobo light mean problem mobo cpu ram easily thing light mean problem psu thanks help,1

After two weeks, i bought the ryzen with the mobo, installed all and re installed windows.

Now, the pc randomly shut down when this things happen:

* Maximize or minimize a game
* Start a game

There's no relation with voltages of the PSU or heat because it can crash on the lobby or even when i open the game for first time. Also, i can let the game minimize for a while and when i want to go back, the pc shut down from nowhere.

I used the prime95 to stress memory and cpu without crash

Now, i put back the 7i 7700k to test if the mobo+cpu is the problem (had to reinstall windows because amd drivers make unestable with BSOD) but i don't think that a driver problem could be causing a shutdown without a BSOD.

First i was thinking about the new bios for this ryzen series but i didn't find anyone with the same issue.

"Windows Error - Cause of WoW?

Hey!

sooo basically I’ve been playing wow on my old set up for about 3-4 years.. NO PROBLEMS AT ANY TIME!

2 weeks before SL I Upgraded my Motherboard and my CPU (along with new RAM and a new SSD) 

I installed everything I had installed before (just some things less, but nothing I had not installed before)!

3 days after the installation my pc hang up and threw me into windows „repair“ (couldn’t repair had to boot off another device) 

So i brought it back to the shop where I got the things from.. those people told me that I’m installing viruses which destroy my PC. (????) without checking the pc once. What ever I though, they fixed it and I installed the same things again.. 3 days after the exact same thing happened! 

What is the problem ? 

I just installed two 3rd party programs TSM (auctionhouse addon) and overwolf (curseforge)

NOTHING else (only blizzard or steam games)


PC shop guys still saying I’m installing „harmful“ things.. (without evidence)

" 
Edit: I may have found the culprit - I forgot to reattach the WiFi antenna to my CPU. Read somewhere that the antenna boosts BT as well (being on the same frequency). Trying it out in a bit. Thanks for all the responses so far.


Hello, I've been trolling reddit and other sites to help find a resolution for my issue, but so far I have not found one that works, so trying my own post to see if it results to something.

I have an Xbox Wireless Controller (Carbon Black to be exact, if that matters), which I use to play on my PC. I'm literally less than 2 feet away from my monitor and CPU when I play on my PC.

My issue is that when I use a USB cable everything works fine but when I use Bluetooth, my controller disconnects every few seconds or so.

My setup is:

1. I added my controller using Control Panel &gt; Add Device (standard pairing via Bluetooth didn't work), based on this link: [https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows\_10-hardware-winpc/xbox-one-controller-wont-connect-via-bluetooth-but/ac4fefad-dbf5-4d6e-9ce3-05da6b0ac732?page=1](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware-winpc/xbox-one-controller-wont-connect-via-bluetooth-but/ac4fefad-dbf5-4d6e-9ce3-05da6b0ac732?page=1)
2. I have fresh batteries for the controller.
3. All drivers up-to-date, Windows 10 version 1909, build 18363.1198
4. MSI b550m pro-vdh wifi motherboard for Bluetooth receiver (Intel).
5. literally 1-2 feet distance between my CPU and my controller, no electronics in between that may cause interference.
6. I cannot change my WLAN channel to another frequency for the shitty reason that my ISP has locked our router and I still do not have admin access to it.

Troubleshooting done so far:

1. Reviewed all drivers and ensured everything up-to-date.
2. Windows already updated to latest version.
3. Tried turning off PC wifi, removing all Bluetooth devices connected except the controller itself
4. Removed all possible interference (phones, appliances, metals, etc.) in between CPU and
5. Tested at both close distance (1-2ft) and couch-to-TV distance (6-7ft)

Issue still exists.

Oddly, other input devices like my wireless keyboard and mouse (uses a Bluetooth receiver) works fine. However, a Bluetooth speaker I try to connect to the PC via Bluetooth also flakes out.

It may be painfully obvious at this point that it's my PC's Bluetooth receiver that has issues, but I'd like to get a second opinion from you guys before I go and buy a USB Bluetooth dongle.

"I posted about this on r/nvidia in their 457.30 driver discussion thread, but I was hoping if anyone has some way on how to fix this issue.

Ever since I updated my Nvidia Game Ready drivers to 457.30, I have had nothing but issues with game performance. I ran the Heaven benchmark and Cold War and they were both running super slow at averages of 20 fps. The Forza Horizon 4 Demo, the benchmark was running at 30 fps on 1440p with all Ultra settings.

I've tried using DDU, rolling back to version 457.09 or 456.71, hasn't shown anything fixed.

I've found that a temporary solution was to reinstall the drivers, but I would have to keep doing that every time I boot up my PC, or else I would be getting FPS drops. Once I reinstalled the drivers, the performance went up as expected, the Forza demo was averaging at 157 fps and the Heaven benchmark hit an FPS of around 134. However, once I turn off my PC or it reboots, that performance is gone and back to 20-30 fps and I have to spend like 15 minutes reinstalling the drivers again every time.

Only with certain games I get a black screen on my main monitor, games like cuphead (I cant even play this because of it), shovel knight (I can play for a little and then certain areas it just goes black), lego starwars (cant play this either), into the breach (occasionally), enter the gungeon (occasionally), and celeste (cant play this game either sometimes. When it goes black I can hear the game and my second monitor stays on, but the main one turns off. Also, even if I am to remove my second monitor (and yes I remove it on the GPU control panel as well, as some have suggested) and only have my main monitor, it still blacks out on all of those games and occasionally on the internet like watching youtube and such or browsing an article.

Processor: i7-4790 3.6Ghz (stays at around 3.9)

PSU: NXT 650W GOLD

Mobo: ASUS MAXIMUS HERO VII

 

I recently upgraded to a GTX 1070 (from a 960) in hopes of getting a lot better frames on some of the games I play (Rust, Apex, PUBG, CS:GO, Valorant).

My problem is that I'm getting worse frames on games like CS and Valorant then I did with my GTX 960. I have MSI Afterburner so I can also see that my GPU will sometimes stay at around 15-20% even though I'm not at a steady 144ish frames on some light games like valorant or cs, uncapped. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Games like Rust I have received a little boost in fps however my GPU is nowhere near even reaching 65% usage. 

On Apex, my GPU will get pushed to like 80% and i'll have somewhat steady 144fps.

I also ran a benchmark and it pushed my GPU to 100% usage so I'm assuming it's not faulty.

My temps are great, they never went above 70C and regularly stay at around 55C.

Since then, I realized my idle temps are also pretty high (55-60 Celsius). Strangely, my GPU is running at 35-45 degrees, so it’s not hot at all.

"I ordered a PC through NZXT BLD and just received it last week. It had few issues and I have a support ticket in with NZXT but they are taking a while to get back to me so I figured I would try posting here. All the problems I've had point to the GPU but at this point I'm not sure if it's a software or hardware issue. 

When I first plugged it in to set it up, it would not detect my displays properly. It would only show on my 1440p display in 1920x1080 and it would not connect to my 1080p display at all. I thought updating the drivers would fix that but it made it worse. After the update it started to continuously disconnect from the displays about every 5-10 seconds. While this was happening the GPU would not appear in task manager or any other software. 

I was able to fix that by using DDU to so a clean install of the drivers. (I did have to do it twice, it crashed after about an hour the first time and went back to the way it was.) 

 Now the PC seems to be working normally but it still crashes when I play games. I've tested a few games and they all run fine, but after a few minutes they crash and give me the same error about the GPU being removed or no longer detected. 

At this point I think it may be a hardware issue, but I would like to know if there is anything I'm missing or that I can try before sending it back. 

Any advice would be appreciated.

"TL:DR Getting various bluescreen codes on boot, do you suspect CPU or motherboard?

A few days ago, my browser tabs started crashing occasionally. Over the course of the next day, it progressed from this to the entire programs crashing, programs turning into black or white rectangles, my screens flashing between black and the desktop, before finally getting a bluescreen on every attempt to boot.

I have an i5-4690K on Asrock B85M-ITX with 16GB of Corsair RAM and a GTX 1060 6GB. I had a couple SSDs and an HDD and a CX 430M PSU. I built the computer around 2015 and have upgraded several things along the way so I was able to do some amount of troubleshooting, but I'm still not sure where my issue lies.

I am able to reliably get into safe mode, but will get anything from MEMORY_MANAGEMENT to BAD_POOL_CALLER to PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA when I try to boot normally. Because I suspected the GPU due to odd graphics behavior, I tried DDU and clean reinstall but no luck. I tested the GPU in another system and it appears to work there. I tried some older RAM that I know was working and that does not fix the issue either.

I removed all drives and got a spare to try loading a new copy of Windows, but when I use a Windows 10 DVD, I get bluescreened before the first prompt to install. This is where I'm a little more confused, because I don't have other parts that I can keep swapping in and out. I am not sure if I should be looking at the motherboard or CPU (or PSU if there's a way that could have caused this issue) because I don't have another compatible socket to verify what's wrong.

"I bought a new CPU fan. After taking my stock fan off the cpu, some thermal compound fell onto the MOBO right next to the cpu, but I think I wiped it off pretty well with alcohol and qtips. I ended up kind of rebuilding the pc as well, to get better cable management going.

I booted back into windows just fine. Windows said there is an update so I installed and rebooted. After 15 minutes the screen froze up; never happened before. Reset, boot back in, 10 minutes, same thing. I ran sfc/scannow and it repaired some things. I reset to windows before the update. Next freeze and reset results in BSOD “CRITICAL PROCESS DIED”. It’s now in a reset loop.

Does this issue seem to be more aligned with the update, or could it possibly result from hardware issue? I’m worried that thermal compound on the mobo did more harm than I anticipated. But I’m thinking if I effed up the mobo or something it wouldn’t have booted up fine so many times. I appreciate any thoughts on this!

I do that and uninstall the drivers and restart the pc. After I try to reinstall the drivers by downloading GameReady and Geforce Experience as usual but I found that during the installation of the programs themselves it ""load"" forever because it can't find the GPU.

I mean there is the GPU because the HDMI is on it but in device manager it calls it ""Microsoft Basic Display Adapter"" just made by Nvidia. Googling this it says that windows needs an update or something but there isn't one anywhere and if I search it goes on loop search here too.

I really don't know what to do I'm in full panic. My father will kill me if I broke the GPU and I already feel like a fucking idiot for doing so much damage to play a game...   fuck we cant even afford a new one now and he needs to work on here sometimes

"Just a casual day using my PC, I hit restart. What I thought it was a boot that took forever (although I have an M.2 NVMe) was in fact a lack of signal to the monitor.

The PC is like 2 months old (all parts new), except for the GPU, a 5 year-old Windforce GTX 960, that is a loan from a friend until I get my own.

This being said, my first guess is the GPU is dead (I hope no other components have issues). I didn't get any signals of a dying GPU, like artifacts on screen, black screens, loud fan noise, high temperatures, etc.

What I tried:

1. I canged the cable and ports.
2. I ran the monitor with a laptop. It works.
3. I connected the PC to another screen. It doesn't work.
4. I tried rebooting and there were no changes. PC boots normally, but there's nothing on the screen.

Update:

5. I tried with a brand-new GPU and still doesn't work. I'm starting to think it's the motherboard.

"Hi everyone, 

Recently upgraded my PC, replaced pretty  much everything except the GPU. Been great for weeks but tonight just after a game of Warzone, which I don't play on very high settings and have frames locked to 60 and my PC cut off completely and could smell burning. I took the side panel off and tried to switch it back on and a little cloud of smoke came out of the GPU. 

Took the GPU out and PC boots again now. Is my trusty old graphics card dead and this is just a coincidence with the new PC or is there hope of a repair? I don't want to put it back in my PC in case it causes further damage. I can't help but think it's something I've replaced that's caused it because it's been in my old PC paired with a i7-4790k for 5 years-ish.

"Hi, i have only recently got into pc gaming and i have a 3600x, gtx1080 and 32gb 3600mhz ram.

my games run great at 1440p and even sometimes 4k.

on cold war, i can run the game at 1440p ultra everything but raytracing (for obvious reasons) at a solid 60-75 fps.

on cold war, my game suddenly drops to 4fps, and when i manage to go into the settings to change a setting to fix it, it sorts itself out, even if if put the render resolution to higher than 2560x1440, then it happens again. i have tried turning these settings down and it still occurs, even when playing at 720p!

I have no idea how this happens as it happened too on warzone when i had a 4770k. i thought that was the issue but it obviously wasn't. 

it doesnt happen on any other games only cold war and warzone in the past.

I honestly dont have any idea why it does this and it is really frustrating.

Can someone please help me.

"New build pc, 
After two months while i was playing, the screen gets black and reconnect in 2 seconds,and then went back to normal. All was good. Next day I've tried to turn my pc on, but no boot, everything works (fans, lights) but no boot, no signal in TV.

It boot : orange, red, white, and stay in white. All fans working.


What I've tried :

New hdmi cable. 
rebuild it, checked connection cables, cmos rest, i used one ram in each slot, bios clear , booted without graphic card
 ( cpu comes with a graphic card ).
NOTHING WORKED.. SO because of the warranty i replaced  everything but the cpu, but same result . So it's definitely a cpu problem, i got new one and all went back to normal .

❗After two days i was browsing, Pc freeze, mouse is off, keyboard off. Couldn't do anything, i had to shut it down in the hard way. I turned it on , and i got the same problem, white led(vga) on motherboard, all fans working, no signal no boot..
Tried everything from zero but same thing .😢

I'm guessing the cpu is dead!!! I don't know what's wrong? I'm not doing overclocking, or messing with the bios settings! 

Now I'm waiting for a new cpu.. And I'm afraid to get the same results.. Any tips or ideas??

"Hey guys,So I picked up a generic USB controller a couple of weeks ago.The OS (Win 10) recognizes the device, and in controller settings each and every one of the button presses are recognized correctly.

However, most most games I've tried simply ignore its existence.

I've made sure to enable controllers where possible, but no response, can't even re-map the buttons since no button presses are registered.

I've looked around the internet and tried to use the XBOX 360 controller emulator (which seems to be the most suggested solution) with no changes.  


All games I've tried officially support controllers.

Also, Some games (FF IV for example) do work!

"Hi   


So my friends Mic is not working in game and on discord etc as the title suggests, and I am at a loss.  
No amount of google is capable of solving the issue.   


I will explain what we have tried and what the issue actually is.   


What the issue is:  His mic works for recording, even using it on say WhatsApp web to record a voice message works. I can see his mic is active on games in party chat and shows the relative icons when he is speaking but no sound, ie. in COD and discord. I am not the only one who can't hear him and I can hear everyone else so definitely an issue on his end.   


What we have tried:  (Side note I may not get them all because I have tried every possible solution for him I can imagine, and even one's I never even thought of thanks to google hence my actual desperation to make a post)    


\-  Setting his mic to default (obviously),

\-  Setting the privacy on his mic to allow for apps (was already set for apps to use)

\- Checking the control panel settings with a hidden setting that I cannot remember with similar permission settings (I found on google can't remember exactly now) 

\- Updating drivers

\- Using a different mic I had spare 

\- Checking the sound tests in each chat app (Sound tests working can hear himself) 

\- Raising all volume levels to max in sound settings on windows and in whatever chat app

\- Using different USB ports

\- Restarting

\- Uninstalling drivers and re-installing

\- Manually installing drivers

\- Making sure mic(s) themselves were set at max volume 

\- Using multiple different chat apps

\- Removing devices from manager and starting again 

Genuinely a lot more, but the thing that broke my brain is the recording app on windows works, when he uses any party chat app, the mic tests they have work, he can hear himself during them, I can see he is talking through the icons, the fact that it's working over say a voice message on WhatsApp web. 

Is there something out the box someone can suggest that I may not have thought of, has anyone else come across this issue. I only found one person through google searches that had the same kind of issue but there was no solution on whatever forum it was posted just a lot of the basic suggestions all the way to including a complete re-install of the OS.

My PC has been having this issue where:

1. I play a high demanding game (in this case its Borderlands 3/Overwatch, BL3 is on the lowest settings possible and OVW is somewhat high)

2. \~40 mins+ of gaming pass and my monitor goes black. Not off to the point of a ""no signal"" message popping up, just a black screen, power still intact

3. PC either continues to stay on and I can't access anything unless I do a complete restart, or it shuts off. Sometimes it makes a very loud whirring noise on startup, but only for a second or two

4. PC boots up just fine, no error message, no popups, nothing, opens all programs normally

&amp;#x200B;

I've checked my monitors/monitor cables to see if they are faulty, dusted out the inside of my pc completely, making sure that my fans can spin with no interruption from any other cables, rearranged my cables, cleaned out my RAM discs, redid thermal paste, bought /an entire new PSU/ (foolish on my part, ik), played games until having the problem while keeping an eye on my temps by using Core Temp, ran Novabench to see if my pcu/gpu was testing badly ( I can share scores if that would help at all), looked on lots of different forums to see if anyone else was having this issue but no luck

&amp;#x200B;

It never happens outside of running any games, I can run low quality games just fine (Minecraft, Genshin Impact on lowest settings, Borderlands 2, more but you get the idea) but when I play BL3/OVW it has the issue. I could run those games fine with no issues, its become a problem within the past chunk of months.

&amp;#x200B;

A side note that I'm not sure if I should include or not/if its important, I've tried updating my Intel driver and the tool says that theres a new update avaliable and that my PC meets the requirements, but when I go to update it says that my computer isn't compatible.

"Hi,

So I'm a cs player, I've been using GPU scaling in NV panel to make cs 75hz at 1024x768 stretched. I had few issues with calibrating it when I bought it few months ago but since then it's been okay.

I've been experiencing a lot of stuttering recently (since October but probably even before that) so today I figured I'd try to fix it so I restored global NVidia 3d settings and left csgo 3d settings unchanged (I had changed global settings to these csgo's but that wasn't optimal for other games), then the problem started. I just couldn't set my monitor to 75Hz with gpu scaling anymore, with both CRU and with Nvidia control panel. With display scaling instead, I could, but for some reason I couldn't set it to fullscreen stretched, it would only let me set it to this:

[proportions](https://i.imgur.com/6CbnkTG.jpg) - looks decent but it's a bit blurry and shiney (crosshair isn't sharp, it radiates its light)

[fullscreen](https://i.imgur.com/qmtPZAB.jpg) - it cuts the edges to the sides so unacceptable

[no scaling](https://i.imgur.com/XQTr1CB.jpg) - doesn't have either of issues mentioned above but, well, it looks comical with this small picture XD

All with display scaling.

With GPU scaling I couldn't just get that 75Hz option anyhow. The screen scales normal, it's just limited to 60Hz. It also has this weird blurry/shining effect proportions (display) had.

I'm using some cheap ass 1080p monitor and VGA cable but it isn't an issue since 75Hz was working before.

There's also one very interesting thing, with display scaling I've had one of the most smooth and fluent gameplays in years, felt like jumping from Intel Pentium to Ryzen 5900x. So I'd love to keep it at display but have no idea how to get the scaling right.

"Hello guys, we are kinda deseperate cause we're stuck with this issue since 24h. First of all, sorry for my English, it's not my main language.

So here's the situation : my bf and i built a PC for a friend (Setup : SSD NVMe 2 , RTX 3070, Ryzen 5 3600, Aorus B450, Seagate 2To, Vengeance Corsair RAM (2x8go i think)).We installed Windows with a boot USB on the SSD, everything went fine and all, we installed the updates and initialized the HDD  but got a blue screen while we were moving the ""Download"" file from SDD to HDD. We restarted the computer and no more blue screen appeared after. So we went back home and later in the day, my friend told us he got multiple blue screens randomly, somehow manage to play one-two hour of video game, than again random  multiple blue screens.

Errors were :

\- Kmode Exception not Handled

\- DPC Watchdog Violation

\- Kernel Mode Heap Corruption

\-  System Service Exception

\- Kmode Exception not Handled

\- kernel Security Check Failure

\- Driver IRQL Not Less or Equal

\- IRQL not less or equal

&amp;#x200B;

We tried to :

\- update drivers manually but that wouldn't work (PC was freezing to death or BSOD or telling the drivers were already on the last update)

\-  Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanupDism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

\- SFC scann (said corrected multiple errors and corrected them, but still having BSOD after this)

\- Bios motherboard update

\- Finally Reinstallation of Windows that didn't worked (still having multiple BSOD right after the installation)

Does someone have some clue to what's happening, or what we could try to fix this ? He will bring the computer to us tomorrow so we can work on it in a more easy way (cause we tried everything i said above on video call with him). Thanks !

EDIT : Fixed it ! SO i read things on the internet for hours before finding some interesting things about the RAM being not always well handled by AMD and/or the motherboard i use. So what i did was kinda simple but pretty counter intuitive.. I turned ON the XMP profile.. and also installed the AMD software for chipset drivers (from amd website) and .. it worked. Actually i have 4 hours running without any blue screens, did some tests, stress tests, chilling on the computer waiting if a blue screen would show up, and nothing, just a perfectly working computer.

"I have a flickering issue with my monitors. The flickering is very prominent on the RTX2070 (you can see it nearly all the time) but on the GTX970 you can see it well when you first start the PC then it only occurs occasionally after about 30 mins.

Initially thinking it was an issue with the 2070 I requested a replacement, which Scan found to have a flickering issue and a fault with one of the HDMI ports. The second 2070 had the same issue for me and when they tested it, it failed the Heaven benchmark. The third 2070 still had the same issue for me but they found no fault and are testing another before they send it to me. (I currently do not have a 2070 to test any theories) The last update on this was two weeks ago (05/11/2020) where they asked ""if there is anything specific you would like us to try and do with the product to be able to try and replicate your problem."" I asked them to try and replicate my system, specifically focusing on the PSU, as my theory at the time was that the increased power draw of the new graphics card was causing issues. At that point, I hadn't seen the flickering on the 970. My current thinking is the issue is with the monitors.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the list of things I have tried to fix the issue: 

* plugged different cable into each monitor - eliminates cable issue
* flickering only appears on one monitor at a time and has been present on both (when using 2070)
* tried looking for a monitor driver but AOC don't have one 
* reinstalled Nvidia driver
* Tried different ports on the graphics card
* put variable refresh rate on in the display/graphics setting
* plugged in 970 graphics card, flicker present but only one DP so used DP+HDMI (flicker is less prominent and seems to stay on one half on the main screen)
* no flicker present when using 1070 card, using 2 DisplayPorts
* tried old graphics card drivers:
   * \-441.87
   * \-442.19
   * \-442.50
   * \-445.87
   * \-451.61
* used Outervision PSU calculator- 520w should be adequate
* tried 2070 in a different pc with different monitors- no issues (20 min test)
* tried 2070 in a different pc with my AOC monitors- no issues (1-hour test)

&amp;#x200B;

My specs:

Motherboard: ASUS Z97-P

CPU: I5-4690K

GPU: EVGA GTX 970/Gigabyte RTX 2070

RAM: 4x 4GB DDR3 

PSU: Seasonic M12 bronze - 520W

Storage: SATA SSD, SATA 7.2K RPM

Monitors: 2x AOC AGON AG273QX (1440p, 144hz)

&amp;#x200B;

If I can help it I want to avoid returning the monitors until there is no other alternative, as When I returned one of the original monitors (9 dead pixels) to AOC it took 3.5 months to receive the refund. I also need to use the monitors for working from home.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Flickering present on AOC AGON AG273QX Monitors. Flickering is prominent when using RTX2070 and occasional with a GTX970.

"Hi guys,

A few days ago and all of a sudden my gaming rig started to make very weird and loud noise, which I allocated to the AiO-cooler as described in the title (see [video](https://vimeo.com/user127698810/review/482354194/d80ee2bde1)). I took the opportunity to clean my PC, apply some new thermal grease and also mounted the cooling block in the opposite way as it would fit better in my rig and also to see wether the old position could have been the reason for the noise. Sadly the noise comes back from time to time and I need some advice from you guys. I feel like the air in the system might be the problem (see [photo](https://postimg.cc/Xrfbs2M9)). I also observed that the cpu seems to have cooling issues as it is loaded by only 60% before reaching 100°C and therefore being thermally throttled which shouldn't occur at all with a water cooled non overclocked I7-6700k. Do I just need to refill the loop or might the pump be broken? 

I'd be really happy if some of you guys could share your experience and suggest what to do.",noise lack cooling liquid alphacool eisbaer 360 hi guy day ago sudden gaming rig started make weird loud noise allocated aio cooler described title video took opportunity clean apply new thermal grease mounted cooling block opposite way fit better rig wether old position reason noise sadly noise come time time need advice guy feel air problem photo observed cpu cooling issue loaded 60 reaching 100 c thermally throttled occur water cooled non overclocked i7 6700k need refill loop pump broken really happy guy share experience suggest,1

Hi guys,

My brother is a huge fan of CS GO and has spent hundreds of dollars on the game. After a recent update (around June maybe), there is a huge drop in fps. He now gets only 40- 60 fps constantly, before the update he used to get 350-400 fps. System specs : 16GB RAM, GTX 1070-Ti gaming pc.

Already tried options:Drivers updated, Steam re-installed CS, go re-installed, Launch options were set, removed and set again, and Max fps set to 999

Can you please suggest what can be done to improve? I really want to play cs go with my brother :(

"Hello! I recently upgraded to a new laptop (i5-8300h/GTX 1050/60Hz display) and am having a strange issue.

On the two games I play, Rocket League and CS:GO, the game is basically unplayable without Vsync on. The performance is very stable: On Rocket League I get a consistent 120-140 fps without any fps drops, yet it feels awful. It feels like I'm playing on 10 fps, not 120. It's so jittery I can almost make out individual frames(same issue on CSGO). However, the moment I turn on Vsync, it's buttery smooth. However it's horrible to play with Vsync on because of the input lag it causes.

My brother told me this was because of the game producing higher fps than the display refresh rate. However, isn't it true that even at 60hz, 120fps should feel slightly better than 60? In other words, 'you can't have too much fps'? I've played the same games on two different computers, both having 60hz displays, and even when the framerate exceeded 60 it was fine, and actually felt better.

So far I've tried capping the fps to 60 with Vsync off (still feels terrible) and messing around in the Nvidia Control Panel to no avail. I'd really appreciate if anyone knew how to fix this.

"Hey all,

I was wondering whether I could ask for a bit of assistance and I have two questions.

My brother passed away earlier this year and I don’t know what to do with his old gaming PC. It’s been a very long time since I built or customised a PC (and even then I didn’t know what I was doing) so am a bit clueless.

I have three photos (sorry they’re rubbish - if I need to take anymore I can do so when I go back to my mum’s house) - one showing a top down, one showing the graphics card model, the other showing a (tiny!) SSD.

https://imgur.com/a/oxqA9aa

1. From these, admittedly, very inadequate images, can you tell whether this is a fairly new gaming PC? (I.e. one worth me trying to set up for myself). Obviously I’ve googled these components but frankly it doesn’t tell me much about whether I should keep the pc or give to charity.

2. The second question is the odder one. My brother used to access the dark web and buy drugs (ultimately leading to his passing away). I do not want to use (and connect to my network) a PC that has anything dodgy/dangerous/incriminating etc. on it unless doing a clean format of the HD would sort this out. I obviously do not have his log in details for anything so I assume I’d need to use BIOS somehow?

"I've got a Ryzen 3700x system with an MSI B550 A Pro. It had 2 sticks of 8gb Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro (3200mhz CL 16). I decided to purchase another 2 sticks - same speed, same latency. 

I installed the extra 2 sticks which lit up but the problem is the PC wouldn't boot. I removed the extra 2 sticks and then the PC booted fine as normal. 

The model number for the RAM is CMW16GX4M2C3200C16. I can't see it on the compatible list for my motherboard ([https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/support/B550-A-PRO#support-mem-19](https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/support/B550-A-PRO#support-mem-19)) but that said my old RAM (same model) works perfectly fine. 

Does this mean in order to get 4x16gb sticks I need to buy a dedicated pack of RAM?

"So I got the rerelease of koa and when I loaded it up for the first time I had fps dips and lag. Look online and it stated that a patch might help it. Waited and tried again and it still had the same issues. Look online for troubleshooting and did what they said and what I could find out that it wants to run on my laptops integrated gpu and not my nvidia one. When I try to change it in the nvidia control panel and load it up the game crashes. I eventually gave up because the best excuse was my gpu was to old (even though I can play the rerelease destroy all humans with no problem). I recently got ac Syndicate and meet the same problem. It didn't want to use my nvidia gpu. My laptop is only a yr older than the game and I don't get why it can't run it. I have updated my driver multiple time, tried to run in compatibility mode and as administrator, change the settings in the nvidia control panel, and so on. Is there anything I can do besides having to buy anything?

"Hi all,

I've noticed an issue as of the last couple of months whilst using my computer to stream to my friends and try and start up a fun-filled channel. The only problem is, my PC appears to be throttling my upload speed directly related to my home internet. Not just wifi, but ethernet connected directly to the NBN outlet in my apartment.

I've tried calling my ISP and they informed me that my internet services were fine. I'm currently on the **100/40** **Mbps** plan with Mate internet, who have provided excellent service since I moved in May 2019. 

After multiple calls and tests, I finally decided to simultaneously test my mobile connection to the same internet, and my mobile displayed accurate test results. My PC downloads are pretty much always on par with what is expected (90Mbps around there), but my uploads are as low as 3-7Mbps when my mobile and work laptop test at the standard 38-ish Mbps. 

PC Build:

* CPU - Intel s1151 Core i9 9900K
* GPU - Asus  ROG Strix NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 OC Edition 8GB
* Mobo - MSI S1151 ATX MPG Z390 GAMING PRO CARBON AC DDR4
   * Wifi Card - Intel Wireless-AC 9560
* RAM - Corsair 2666MHz Vengeance LPX BLACK RAM PN CMK32GX4M2A2666C16
* Boot SSD - Samsung 500GB SSD 970 EVO Plus

I've tried the following to no avail:

* Resetting network in network settings
* Troubleshooting network issues
* Updating all networking drivers direct from Intel's website
* Updating BIOS
* Looking into using Google DNS (sped up by 1/2Mbps upload speed
* Disabling &amp; re-enabling drivers
* Bypass wifi by using ethernet, same throttled upload speed}
* Using Intel's Driver &amp; Support Assistant to check/update components in my PC
* Using DriverBooster to update any other drivers that may have been missed
* Emailed both Intel &amp; MSI (motherboard manufacturer) to assist as this is a custom built pc (which had been working completely fine for over 13 months)
   * Checking my Intel wifi card base settings in device properties &gt; Advanced tab (had not been changed from their recommendations)
* Disabled firewall when testing speeds to ensure not prevented by the firewall
* Only using Windows defender antivirus software

Having trouble posting images of my build &amp; network tests to prove the discrepancy on my home network, apologies!

"Obviously a stupid question. Yes is the answer. 

However. I have been trouble shooting for a fortnight my new PC which was stuttering in every game. Now about half the games I’ve tried have varying levels of stutter issues. Some only when the graphic options are turned up. 

I had similar issue on my previous PC and the one thing I have reused from that build is the RAM. I also had issues with the ram not being detected and taking them out and trying again only 1 or 2 sticks were being detected. This could have been me still learning and perhaps doing something wrong. But I think it was worth noting. Now all are working. 

Benchmarks seem to think everything is fine. The motherboard has been flashed and full install done by a computer shop near me and this has helped maybe 15% of the games that stuttered. Everything is up to date. I’ve tried numerous Nvidia Control Panel settings for specific game titles. Tomorrow I’m going to try some one else’s graphics card and hopefully ram to see what happens there. My mobo is quite new and someone suggested maybe it has been updated enough? https://www.umart.com.au/Asus-ROG-Strix-Z490-F-Gaming-LGA-1200-ATX-Motherboard_55138G.html That’s it there. 

Is there anyway to check for faults in my RAM? 
And maybe any advice on other potential causes?

"I’ve been struggling with this since installing my new 3080. The whole pc was working fine before then with a 1080. Now I face this problem 2/3 times I boot on the PC. I have tried every fix i could find and nothing has worked.

I had to cut a hole in my case to allow airflow for the 3080 (im using an NZXT H1 with fans for exhaust) and I’m worried that the metal dust that was created from that might not have been fully cleaned and may have gotten into components. Would this cause this type of problem?

i should note that when i upgraded my motherboard to the one currently in the spec list... well i forgot to heat the thermal paste and kind of pulled the cooler slowly with little force to then with alot and well it pulled the cpu from the socket without opening it. i know im sorry. but it bent a full row of pins but i was able to install it and it worked fine. 



So basically my problems started with a windows update. A couple days after i got a blue screen unfortunately i cannot remember the code... you'll understand why soon. Then my pc wouldn't reboot so i pressed the reset button. In turn the dram led came on and my pc would no longer post. After removing the sticks and fiddling around i came to the Conclusion that the B2 ram slot was no longer working. I know it's the slot because the ram works in the others woth xmp on or off. i was using my pc as normal waiting for Sunday to come around to try to fix the issue as i was busy most of the day. It is not yet Sunday and the time of writing this but i had some free time. so first thing i did was update my bios to version 1202. Woop woop ram was working as normal until it wasnt. When i restarted my system it was gone again. The dram light was on again. I switched back to the working preset which was slot A1 and A2. I then decided to do a fresh windows install after some struggling of trying to get my ssd to cooperate and let me install i got there and once again it worked and once again it stopped. I got another blue screen after booting in this configuration talking about wireless drivers being the cause. i unistalled my wireless drivers when suddenly windows just wouldn't work. Another clean install later windows ran into more problems now on the third install i got quite far i had all but 4 drivers installed and when i used driver booster to install them thinking they were insignificant, well after restarting the pc to finish the update it froze on the lock screen.The ram was working fine after multiple restarts in slot B2 and A2 just after those last four drivers got updated that's when it started again. I tried running xmp to basically see was it working and it went again with dram light on. Driver booster made a restore point before updating the drivers but my bootable usb media wouldn't recognize it.

Does it have to be a parts problem? Even if RAM checked out could that be the issue or any other parts?

"Hello all,

I have come to your lair in the hopes of great wisdom, so that i can get more frames whilst playing video games.

It is my first post here, so ill try and stick to all the rules, however please let me know if i break any and i will correct them asap.

I recently upgraded my CPU from an i5-6500 to AMD Ryzen 5 3600x, which resulted in a much smoother experience in warzone.

Before buying the CPU, i watched a video of my current setup in warzone, ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puAPv9Z5wgM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puAPv9Z5wgM)) which shows much higher frames per second, compared to what i get. (Ryzen 5 3600x + RTX 2060 Super + 16 gb 2133mhz RAM)

Now, in some areas, i can hit perhaps 150 fps, those are mostly the out in nowhere areas. The moment i go to an urban area (yes i am aware that frames might drop there) i plummit down to 90-110 ish. To test this out, i run the exact same settings as the youtube video, drivers are all updated and i even drop the same places as the guy in the video, yet, i dont get close to the same results as him.

Anyone got any ideas of what might be causing this issue? the video is from June 2020, but i cant make myself believe that instead of fixing the game, making everyones FPS better, they would go the direct oppisite direction. However, it is afterall Activision.

Im open to any suggestions, come with ideas i should try out, or something that dramatically increased YOUR fps.

(Yes, i've seen these different youtube videos of people coming up with all kinds of things to do to get better fps, but they dont know why it increases fps. I dont trust people like them.)

"Hi, I've recently purchased new components for a Ryzen build. The build:

Ryzen 7 3700x

16GB Corsair Vengeance Pro 3200 CL16

MSI MPG B550 Gaming Plus

(Components that aren't new are:

Gigabyte GTX 1070

Corsair CX650M

and my SSDs/HDD)

For the case I went with the NZXT H510 Elite. This case comes with 2 NZXT AER RGB 2 fans included, which are connected to the Smart Device v2 RGB/Fan controller (included as well). The Ryzen came with the Wraith Prism cooler, which is also RGB capable.

Both, the cooler and the RGB fan controller by NZXT, are connected to the mobo via a USB header.

Now something really weird happens, something I have never seen in my years of building PCs before. While connected to the mobo via the USB headers, both devices, the controller and the cooler, lose connection seemingly at random, just to reconnect a split second later. Depending on vibrations in and around the case, this connecting/disconnecting thing may happen every second, with windows playing that usb connect/disconnect sound 10 times in a row. While this happens, the NZXT usb device disappears and reappears in the device manager and the rgb software gains and loses connection to the fans (the amd prism cooler loses its lighting profile as well). This appears to affect the whole system from time to time, since my playstation controller as well as usb mouse and keyboard lose and regain connection, too.

A possible solution for this is to apply pressure with my finger directly on the motherboard. At first I thought pushing on one of the headers would help, but it doesn't matter if I push on the headers or somewhere else. The farther away from the usb pins I push, the more pressure I have to apply to keep a constant connection. This is reproducable 100% of the time. I tried tightening the screws that hold the mobo but unfortunately I cant screw them further in anymore.

I really dont know why pushing on the circuit board would help with what appears to be loose connections. Or is it something else entirely? Is it maybe a power issue? To many devices using usb? I cant tell and this pushing solution just creates more questions. I also thought that maybe the small current that flows through my fingers had something to do with it, but pushing with any object, while applying enough force, resulted in a stable connection for all devices.

Hope yall can untie this mess. Are the usb pins defective, is this a bios issue, should I get the same board again or is it a psu thing?

"I've posted before and feel I'm getting ever-nearer to the problem itself.  I've been having occasional frame drops and visual stutters in nearly all games and sometimes when doing video playback (personal movies on Amazon and in Youtube videos) and I've been fiddling with system settings and in-game settings alike to try to flush out the issue, but it remains an irritation.  The games are certainly playable enough, but it's an irritant that I would prefer to be not present, you know?

My current specs are a Ryzen 7 3700X, GTX 1070 Ti, Crucial MX500 1 TB SSD, and Patriot 3600 C17 Series 2x 8GB.  It's a pretty good system, I'd think, so the in-game stutters (mild as they are) and in video playback should be near-nonexistent.

My monitor is an LG 32GK650F-B 32"" QHD 144 Hz with FreeSync (which is now currently enabled and did not fix the issue).  I also use an Oculus Quest 1 with the Link software and a decent third-party cable, and that stutters in PC VR games, too, so it's not just an issue with the monitor, I think.  Is there an issue with the graphics card, perhaps?

Hello, 

Thank you if you take the time to read my problem !:)

I've been having a problem since I got my new ""PNY GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER XLR8 Gaming Overclocked Edition"" graphics card. (I had a GTX 970 that stopped working).

When I'm on my desktop / internet / series, I have a part of the screen that ""jumps"" very briefly, it doesn't even last a second, it happens irregularly (sometimes several times a minute, sometimes nothing for 10 minutes). BUT I do not encounter this problem while playing game. 
My screen is an AOC 24"" LED - 24G2U/BK. I don't encounter this error on my second ASUS PA238 screen but I want to be able to enjoy my main monitor without worries. 

Video of the problem : https://streamable.com/4694fp

I have already done :

-Changing DisplayPort Cable to HDMI

-Uninstalled driver and reinstalled 

-Then used Display Driver Uninstaller DDU

-Changed the 16x PCI Express slot graphics card. 

-Switch the screen to 60Hz

-Checked FreeSync and Gsync compatibility options in Nvidia settings

-Changed Nvidia settings ""Activate G-sync, compability G-Sync"" from ""Activate for full screen"" to ""Activate for borderless fullscreen"" (I thought it could work since I have no problem while gaming but it's always happening on desktop.)

The bug disappears from my screen if I don't connect it to the 1660 Super graphics card but use the graphics chipset of my CPU instead. 
As I said the bug is not present if I plug the graphics card on my other screen. 

Items in my config that could help : 

-Screen: AOC 24"" LED - 24G2U/BK - 144Hz

-Second screen : ASUS PA238 - 60Hz

-Processor: Intel Core i7 4790K - 4.0 ~4.4 Ghz

-Cooling: Corsair H60 (Watercooling)

-Motherboard: ASUS Z97-Pro Gamer

-Graphics Card: PNY GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER XLR8 Gaming Overclocked Edition

-RAM: Corsair Vengeance DDR3-1600 CL9 LP 16GB (4 x 4GB)

-Power Supply: Cooler Master G750M 80+ Bronze

Temps were staying at 35°C during the test.

I would tend to think that the problem comes from the graphic card I received because with my old graphic card I didn't have this problem. But I truly don't know, could it be the monitor ? Both GPU &amp; Monitor are recent and under warranty but I would take a long time I think and I'm not even sure where is the problem coming from.

"So I recently got myself a gaming set up, I'm super new to all of this. I have a 65"" Samsung 80t, which is connected to my new PC and the new Xbox.

When I was trying to set up the xbox, the tv would go purple and lined and glitchy upon loading some games. Looking it up, I saw that my tv needed a firmware update, from 1402 to 1403.

Upon installing the update, the xbox worked wonderfully, 4k 120Hz. An unintended side effect was my PC suddenly was also able to do those settings, and I was so happy.

Cut to a few days later and I notice my picture has degraded quality. Like my backlight is maybe too bright or something, it looks washed out, and I no longer have the ability to set my PC to 4k 120Hz.

The 80t has one gaming port, and I was using that for the Xbox, but the other one seemed to work for the PC and its settings. Today, trying to fix it, I unplugged the xbox from HDMI 4 (the gaming one) and my PC into it, and I still cant get 4k @ 120Hz.

What happened? Did it change something automatically? I apologize for my ignorance, but I'm really hoping someone can explain where I went wrong, I was so happy for a few days lol.

Tried cleaning the fans and updating Windows, but so far no luck. I'm using stock fans from the LanCool 2. CPU temp doesn't go down when I lower my configurations either.

Any help or advice would be appreciated. This is my first time posting on this forum too, so please let me know if there's any other info that would be helpful to provide. I have added my temps reported by Speccy and the Userbenchmark. Thank you.

"Hey guys, thanks for the interest.

This will be relatively short, given that I'm a bit of a nub here and can't really articulate my problem too well.

I recently picked up a new RTX 3070 and an ASUS VG27AQ monitor. This is a 27"" 1440p monitor that I am running along side a crappy old 24"" 1080p monitor. I upgraded the video card about 2 days before upgrading the monitor.

So far all is well, however, I've noticed a new anomaly in my experience with AC: Valhalla ever since the monitor upgrade. Every now and then the screen will go black for about a second and then come back.It appears that the game switches from fullscreen @ 144hz to borderless @ 60hz. I change it back and it stays for a bit, but inevitably it flips back. Very annoying! This seems to be correlate with the new monitor purchase as I did not have the issue when I was on my old monitor with the 3070. I have not noticed any FPS drops or any oddities before the screen blanks.

Could this have something to do with G-Sync? Or is there a setting conflict Im not aware of? I ask this because when I wake my PC up from sleep it spends a good while sorting out the resolution issues (That is to say, the second monitor resolution changes a bit before settling on 1920 x 1080, then the primary (VG27AQ) monitor wakes up and does the same thing before settling on it's proper resolution) then Windows advises me to finish setting up G-Sync. So far it seems to be setup properly in the Nvidia control panel? I suspect these two issues are correlated but I dont have the knoweldge or insight to connect them.

I am 100% open to trouble shooting here but Im just not sure where to begin! Any help is appreciated.",odd hz change ac valhalla window resolution issue hey guy thanks relatively short given bit nub really articulate problem recently picked new rtx 3070 asus vg27aq monitor 27 1440p monitor running crappy old 24 1080p monitor upgraded video card 2 day upgrading monitor far noticed new anomaly experience ac valhalla monitor upgrade screen black second come appears game switch fullscreen 144hz borderless 60hz change stay bit inevitably flip annoying correlate new monitor purchase old monitor 3070 noticed fps drop oddity screen blank g sync setting conflict im aware ask wake sleep spends good sorting resolution issue say second monitor resolution change bit settling 1920 x 1080 primary vg27aq monitor wake thing settling proper resolution window advises finish setting g sync far setup properly nvidia control panel suspect issue correlated dont knoweldge insight connect 100 open trouble shooting im sure begin help appreciated,1

I have a new-ish PC that recently started acting oddly. It was fine for months (at least I didn't notice the issue), but lately it will act weird. I first noticed it playing Fortnite with my daughter. If I'm running forward I'll see a slight dip in FPS (locked at 60 but I'll see 54ish) and my mouse won't respond accurately. Also, if I'm running forward and the issue hits, I'll keep running forward even if I let go or move another direction until the stutter clears.

I tried lowering graphics settings, but that didn't help. I had copied my user profile from an old PC and the issue was so annoying that I completely reinstalled the OS on a different HDD as well. Issue persisted, but then I realized I was a moron and forgot a few drivers. Updated those and the issue seemed to abate, but then I realized it just takes time to manifest. Clean install, totally up to date, after X time it starts to stutter. Then I finally noticed that it will happen anywhere, not just games. If I'm typing in FB the text will stop showing up but if I continue typing, it'll all spit out after the stutter. At first I thought it might be either FB or a memory leak in Chrome, so I totally uninstalled Chrome and stayed off FB, but even still after however long, the issue seems to pop up.

Further, it happens on my daughter's PC as well I'm finding. She was complaining about lag in Fortnite, so I tried the same steps of lowering gfx settings to fuzzy potato and doing updates. Her computer will still stutter, cache typing, and have a jittery mouse for a few seconds even when not playing games and just using the internet.

Daughter's PC is my old one. i7-6700k with GTX970. Not amazing, but it wasn't acting like this when I had it. My new PC is a Ryzen 3700x with a GTX2070 Super definitely shouldn't have issues running Fortnite on medium or typing in FB. It also was not doing this when it was first built. I find it odd that both started doing the same thing around the same time but it makes me suspect something like Windows itself as there's pretty much nothing in common between the two beyond that.",stuttering gaming userbenchmarks game 103 desk 85 work 109 amp x200b model bench cpu amd ryzen 7 3700x 81 1 gpu nvidia rtx 2070s super 126 4 ssd toshiba thnsn5512gpuk nvme pcie 2 512gb 177 8 hdd sabrent 1tb 413 4 ram g skill f4 ddr4 3600 c16 4x8gb 67 2 mbd asus tuf gaming x570 plus wi fi new ish recently started acting oddly fine month notice lately act weird noticed playing fortnite daughter running forward slight dip fps locked 60 54ish mouse respond accurately running forward hit running forward let direction stutter clear tried lowering graphic setting help copied user profile old annoying completely reinstalled o different hdd persisted realized moron forgot driver updated abate realized take time manifest clean install totally date x time start stutter finally noticed happen game typing fb text stop showing continue typing it'll spit stutter thought fb memory leak chrome totally uninstalled chrome stayed fb long pop happens daughter's finding complaining lag fortnite tried step lowering gfx setting fuzzy potato update computer stutter cache typing jittery mouse second playing game using internet daughter's old i7 6700k gtx970 amazing acting new ryzen 3700x gtx2070 super definitely issue running fortnite medium typing fb built odd started thing time make suspect window pretty common,1

"Hello all, I was recently able to pick up an Xbox series x from Target. On my current setup I’m using a HP Omen 27i, it’s specs are 1440p 165hz 1ms response IPS panel. I was thinking of upgrading to 4K, I cannot afford a 4K 120hz, so it would have to be a 60hz display.

"Soo,

Yesterday I assembled, my pc, at first I had a problem with the bios, but reseting the CMOS worked. Now I have a problem with windows!!

I created a bootable USB using the windows media Creation tool. It got stuck on the windows logo (even before I could select a drive to install to) I formatted the usb, reinstalled everything and the same problem occurs.

I also tried a 32gb usb stick that came with the files pre-installed, it askes me if I want to install 64 or 32 bit windows. I need 64 bit so when I check that, it proceeds to a screen that gets shown on startup (mobo manufacturer) and it is stuck on this screen.

Observations / things I tried:

Reseated cpu and ram.

Tried only one ram slot (with all ram modules) and still the same problem. I don't think it is one of my 2 ram modules since it does detect a change in my config/shows correct amounts/ shows correct timings

Mobo lights up and all fans spin

Ssd is checked using the tool built into my mobo

"So, recently I got myself an RTX 3070 Founders Edition, and it's been pretty good. **However**, I've noticed that it never goes beyond \~80% GPU usage, even if the FPS is struggling to even stay at 60fps, even on 1080p. My Ryzen 5 2600x CPU usually sits at around \~50% utilisation on games like Watch Dogs: Legion, GTA V, etc, so I don't think it's a CPU  bottleneck. I'm getting far lower FPS than what is expected of a 3070 and I'm not currently sure why that's the case. As per the rules, I've tried multiple times to run UserBenchmark, but the GPU test always comes up as incomplete. It will test the GPU and I will get ""Waiting for sustained writes"" over 60 seconds until the application closes and I get given an incomplete report.

"Hi guys! I need some help diagnosing my issue.

First, my setup:

Ryzen 5 3600 
GTX 1080 Gigabyte Windforce
2x8 GB G.Skill Ripjaws (running at 3466mhz)
MSI B450 Tomahawk
PS XPG Core 650W
Crucial MX500 500GB (Windows)
Crucial BX500 1TB (Games and garbage)

Issue: Games will freeze for a few seconds and then crash. No error messages. Forza Horizon 4, Hitman, Hitman 2, GTA V, etc. They all do the same. The only game that does not randomly crash is League of Legends but if I Alt + Tab during the game, it will crash. For some reason it does not happen during the loading screen. This started happening just a few days ago and the windows error log does not give a lot of information but says that the error is affecting  Kernelbase.dll so I might have to install Windows again.

Things that have changed recently:

Upgraded RAM. I was running 2x8 GB Corsair 3000mhz and got 3600mhz but my movo won’t take anything over 3466 so I had to adjust the speed. This happened a couple of weeks ago and I don’t think it is crashing the games as I was able to play just fine for almost 2 weeks.

Started running a Linux virtual machine a few weeks ago. I don’t think this is the problem but you never know. Games were running just fine for weeks tho.

Updated Windows. I am almost sure this is the issue based on the Windows error log but I’d like to know what other things I can try before doing a clean install as it takes ages and it is definitely the last resort.

I have checked temps and everything is the same. Both the CPU and GPU have had the same temps for months.

What do you think? Any ideas? Thank you!


UPDATE 1: Updated Nvidia drivers and the issue was the same.

UPDATE 2:Update Frameworks (pending update) and the issue was the same. This was known to cause crashes.

UPDATE 3: Started playing with my ram overclocking and lowered the frequency (kept the same timings) and it seems to have fixed the issue. I played R2R2 high settings for quite some time and no crashes. It seems like this might have fixed the issue.

"I recently bought a MSI GTX 1070 gaming X graphics card that was previously mined with. Once I had plugged the GPU into the PCIe Lane and connected the HDMI cable and turned on the PC there was no signal given out by the graphics card so I turned the PC off and connected the HDMI cable to the motherboard to boot off my CPUs built-in igpu then turned on the computer and booted perfectly fine. Once in Windows I opened device manager and expanded on display adaptors but only my Intel HD Graphics were shown with my GPU is still being plugged into PCIe Lane, which I found weird because with my past experience with mined graphics cards the GPU would either have a altered BIOS or a bricked BIOS and would appear in display adaptors with a hazard symbol next to the device's name.

 I then downloaded nvflash to try and flash the gpu's original BIOS to it. Once trying to install the nvflash software could not recognise the GPU. I have tried cleaning the PCIe Lane on the motherboard and on the GPU and tried using a GPU in Multiple motherboards but have had the same problem I have even disassembled the graphics card to give it a good clean down and to check the voltages of the different components and all the values seem to be correct.

"Hi. At June 6th, I finished building my first PC. 

All good, up until a week ago, when I shut down and a Windows Update kicked in.

The day after, Windows suddenly didn’t recognize one of my storage M.2 SSD, as if it never existed. All of my games and work were missing. Tried everything, and the solution I found was to open the BIOS, so the computer sets in and recognizes it before initializing Windows 10. 

Everyday is a new problem. Today, I woke up to find all of my Steam games “Corrupted”, ALL OF THEM. It takes so much time to uninstall the games, and even more time to download them. My internet test is at 412MB/s, and I never had this trouble; but now, it took 13 minutes to download 166MB, and it stopped due to no network. Never had this problem. 

Have in mind, throughout this 5 month period, I would turn off my PC and the fans would go INSANELY FAST and a *click* sound would be loudly heard. Minor concern, didn’t give much to it; Now, after the driver not being recognized and all of that, the PC won’t even shut down. The fans and RGB are still working and I have to unplug it, which is oddly weird. I think that something is messed up but I have no idea why. 

I have no idea what happened. If I messed up, or if it’s a virus. Please, I desperately need help! Thank you for reading.

"Need some help trying to figure out of the lag my friend/roommate is experiencing is because of the PC and how it is setup or if it is the server which is causing the lag. 

The game where he is experiencing the lag is warzone and haven't tested any other games yet (newer PC so not a lot of gameplay on it yet). The PC is a brand new build with ASUS X-570, RYZEN 5 3600x, RTX 2060 super and 16GB 3200mhz of Ram and was built less than a month ago and paired with a 60hz monitor. The PC is plugged directly into the modem and internet download speeds are in the 180-220 mbps range, and during gameplay the latency is 20-30ms (ignoring the gameplays where the ping will jump for random reasons where lag is expected). Have set the RAM speeds in Bios, installed drivers for the RTX 2060 super, but haven't done a motherboard update yet.

The reason why I am curious to know if the PC is contributing to the lag is because we play on the same network in the house, and yet he will experience lag when I don't. We normally play during the hours of 8pm till midnight. I play on my PC as well (i7 8700, 1660ti, and 322gb RAM) using a google mesh wifi point that I plugged into. He will have no background apps running, while I will have google chrome with multiple tabs and a few other background apps running while playing. It seems like their is no difference in who is host in terms of when the lag will affect my roomate. So is there anything we can do PC wise to fix the lag is or is it on the server side to which cause the lag?

" Hi all, I just installed a new PSU and an RTX 3070. I had a few issues after install where I had to short the CMOS to get the PC to boot past VGA, but otherwise it was fine, until recently - every so often my pc now shuts off (displays go black, no signal) and the GPU fans speed up to 100%. It stays like this until I turn it off or restart. One time after it did this, it encountered the same error of not booting past VGA, and another time it booted to the windows screen saying it had failed to load or whatever. These crashes are unrelated to load, and have happened while idle on the desktop with no apps open other than chrome. Yesterday I managed to play \~2 hours of Apex Legends on the highest settings with no issues. Presumably if it was a power or thermal issue it wouldn't be able to tolerate higher strain without shutting off in the same way.

I'm not really sure what could be the problem. I was sure the PSU supplied enough power, but maybe not? Specs below. More than happy for any advice you guys can provide. I just updated the BIOS on my motherboard, hoping that would help, but now it encounters the same error on boot - stuck at VGA. I'll probably have to short the CMOS again to get it to boot properly.

Hello friends, I've been experiencing continuous drops in fps, stuttering, screen tearing and input lag -among other problems- forever. I've been troubleshooting this problem for a year, I've put my limited knowledge and the might of the internet to fix this. I don't know what to do from here. Name a solution and I've probably tried it. I've recently spent a lot of time cleaning up my ssd and hard drive, uninstalling fluff that came with my laptop or stuff i didn't need (and didn't know i had). Drivers, OS, Background processes, apps, everything pertinent has been updated or optimized. The only thing I know for sure that I haven't tried is changing my entire peripheral setup (HyperX), but I can't see that being the problem. I'm not super knowledgeable about computers but putting every resource at my disposal towards fixing this issue SHOULD have worked. I'm sure this is fixable.   


This is not an isolated issue to any one game, stuff just don't run well for me. There's obviously something very wrong all around, but it's been truly tragic on Destiny 2 which I've heard is one of the best optimized games out there and my setup should easily run. Speaking of, my rig consists of the following according to GeForce Experience because I'm not good at remembering specs:

"So an hour ago I was in the middle of enjoying the new Assassin's Creed Valhalla, when both of my 2 monitors went black and then said ""no signal"". First thing I did was power cycle them, then unplugged the DP / DVI cables yet still no response. I turned off my PC, and turned it on again, and still nothing. I've taken my PC out, unplugged the GPU, slotted it back in, and re-attached just the one DP monitor. Still no response. I'm at a complete loss and not sure how to diagnose this issue if I can't get any display working. 

The PC will restart, and all inside components appear to light up and work properly when doing so. 

(I'm confident it's not the cables as BOTH monitors Lost display signal at the same time. Also one monitor is a 2K 144Hz DP - DP, the other is a 1080p, 60Hz DVI - DP.) 

I'm worried it's a GPU fault, if so, is there a way to fix which won't result in me having to buy a new one, because I bought it not too long ago?

Hello all,

I recently built a a new CPU. Here is the list of parts [https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/9kwh7X](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/9kwh7X). Everything is working fine I can play YouTube, open a billion tabs on google, use discord, etc... However, when I play games such as Monster Hunter World, FF14, or Phasmophobia the game will crash and say that I have a D3D error. I can play games like among us, and battle block theater just fine.

I am using an old hard drive that has only ever had games on it. It has never had an operating system installed. 

I notice there is some coil wine when I launch the high demand games, the resolution is off to a point where in phasmo it looks like my monitor is a phone screen, and I notice that my CPU and GPU both fly to 100% load upon launching those games followed by a crash.

I've:

Done a GPU bench mark results say its fine

Installed newest drivers

Switched GPU to max power settings

Uninstalled and Reinstalled the games

Nothing has worked

Any thoughts?",new graphic card build giving d3d error playing game help hello recently built new cpu list part working fine play youtube open billion tab google use discord play game monster hunter world ff14 phasmophobia game crash say d3d error play game battle block theater fine using old hard drive game operating installed notice coil wine launch high demand game resolution point phasmo look monitor phone screen notice cpu gpu fly 100 load launching game followed crash gpu bench mark result say fine installed newest driver switched gpu max power setting uninstalled reinstalled game worked thought,1

There are tutorials for this online but it involves heading to the bios and making the change. This ensures you get the best speed possible for your memory. If you have issue changing it (as I did) due to crashing and instability then your best bet is to gradually raise it until your computer is stable.

Hello all,

I hope you can hear it behind the fan noise in the video above.

I have a noise which does not come from the fans, but I think, from the power supply coils. It's like an engine revving repeatedly...woaao wooao wooaao...

My PC has only a few months, it does it from the beginning, but I just realised now...I really thought that the noise came from the neighbor's washing machine.

Do you know how to solve it? Is it related to the variable power management done by the Motherboard BIOS?

"So initially my PC was able to boot, and was working fine for everything except games, which should be running between 107 - 160fps, but we’re averaging 15fps. 

Turns out this was because I had no graphics drivers installed, so I first installed the latest Nividia drivers. Halfway through installation, it crashed. So I retried in safe mode, which worked until I tried to restart the computer, which would crash on boot until I reverted it to a previous state.

I flipped through my motherboard manual and found there were drivers I was supposed to install with a disc provided, so I borrowed an external disc reader and all was well, but still terrible FPS. 

I tried the Nividia drivers again, same problem. I was recommended to use a DDS and try again, which I did. This, for whatever reason, caused my computer to crash on boot after a few seconds.

I decided to cut my losses and start again, factory resetting the computer - it wiped, but windows couldn’t finish installing, and now I can’t even make it post.

"I built a new pc about a month ago, no issues however I found out I needed to enable XMP in the bios in order to get my RAM speeds to as advertised. It's meant to be 3200mhz but default is 2333mhz. When I enabled it and set the speeds in the bios and saved changes, I'd get a boot loop and then it would reset the speeds back to default 2333mhz. I looked up online and it said to move the 2 ram sticks to A2 and B2 instead of A1 and B1 which I was using before. After moving them, it says no signal on my monitor and I've tried moving the ram sticks back to A1 and B1 but still no signal.

When the computer is powered on, the CPU, Memory, and GPU lights come one briefly, then the computer appears to restart and immediately the same lights come on and go back out. The BOOT_DEV light then comes on and stays on. I expect that means the drive itself has failed, but that shouldn’t prevent the display should it?

"So I have been building computers for about seven years now and still cannot fix my problem. My computer has many different issues that seem to be related. Here is a list of symptoms:

1. Garbled Audio (randomly, usually after using the computer for a little bit but completely random)
2. Stuttering audio in youtube videos that repeats its self example: ""hello and welcome \* welcome to this \* to this post about \*about my issues\* issues"". Then when I go to restart it stays on the ""Restarting"" loading screen (This also affects the mouse which usually stutters in time with the stuttering of the video).
3. /*I think I fixed this issue by using a different usb port?*/The mouse will randomly turn off, seems to get really bad for about 5 mins (turns off for a few secs then turns back on) then the issue stops for sometimes hours.
4. Video games will freeze when the mouse turns off sometimes but videos will still play on my other monitors.
5. Random audio glitches when loading a fresh video on a new webpage.
6. Bad latency from HDaud driver, DirectX 12 driver, storport, and Nvidia drivers
7. I Use pro tools a lot (Digital audio workstation application) and I will get CPU usage errors when there is less than 50% CPU used (per core none are above 50% so it is not a core overload)

I am not getting BSOD however, so it is very hard to find answers. I have tried many solutions and none have worked:

1. Updating drivers (all kinds, with different programs and getting them from the manufacturer's website)
2. I made sure that the computer cannot put any of my USB devices or audio devices to sleep.
3. Restarting my audio interface in a temporary solution to some of the issues (garbled audio) but does not help with issue #2
4. Changing my sample rate from 48K to 44.1k and back fixed issue #2 but was only temporary

I am also not seeing any spikes with the hard disk or SSD that might cause some of these glitches. When issue # 4 happens, there is a dip in GPU usage but no spike in anything else.

I'm starting to think it might be one of my hard drives but I tried QueitHDD with no help. Also, the hard drive with no programs on it (my backup drive for music projects) is the one I am concerned about since it is the oldest but it just doesn't make sense to me.

Any help with this is very much appreciated! I have been dealing with these issues for months now and similar issues for years (bad audio glitches).

"So like I said in the title, I woke up a few days ago and found my pc just severely under performing while playing games.

Another thing to add is that in DMC lowering the settings didn't do anything, nor did it do anything in GTA.

After about a week of having it I started getting terrible stutters, not just only on games but aswell on my desktop when I would move my mouse. I immediately assumed that it had to be my monitor.

Today I received my monitor from LG which is also 144hz and its gsync compatible, for anyone wondering its the LG 27GL850-B. And after setting it up I had 1 of 2 problems. 1. the Hz could only go up to 100. and 2. I was still having the same stuttering problem. If anyone can help me and tell me what the problem might be I'd be extremely grateful.

"I'm at my wit's end here and could really use some help.

My Windows 10 computer has been unusably slow due to 100% disk use as shown in the task manager. The top results for Disk use inntask manager are System, Registry, and a lot of items that start with Service Host. 

I thought maybe the reason was that my PC needed an update, so I tried installing them, which took all day. I thought it was working until it said:

""There were some problems installing some updates."" 

I think maybe the updating software became corrupted somehow. I tried some solution I found online requiring the Services app, but the computer's so slow that I cant even open it. 

Ive done about four different scans for malware and found nothing, and I'm not sure how I could have picked up malware anyways. I think its some kinda bug with the updating software. 

I cant think of anything else to do other than just reinstall Windows or something. I've been trying to fix this for 12 hours and would really appreciate some help.

EDIT: Thanks for all the help, people! I think the problem was some kind of corruption in the updating code that put the updates in a total loop. I managed to reset Windows and things are looking fine now. 

As for all the tips on getting an SSD installed, I'll bet my old hard drive has something to do with it as well. I'll hopefully be installing one this week. Again, thanks a bunch for the advice.

"Hi,

Last night I was working on my PC and turned it off. Today when I tried to turn it on I got no signal, no post or nothing.

I think the problem might be the motherboard (Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E), because the LEDs stopped working a while ago, and some weeks ago I noticed some of the RAM slots are not working. But I'm not sure how to confirm it.

To test what might be faulty I started disconnecting components from the MB to see if after disconnecting something I might get some kind of signal on the monitor, so right now the motherboard it's just connected with the CPU, front chassis fans and PSU and still no signal.

Also while disconnecting components I noticed my CPU cooling and CPU look like this but I don't know if that's normal:

"I hope everyone is doing well during the covid-19 pandemic. I locked myself out of permissions for my AWS cloud while studying for my AWS cloud Practitioner Exam. I am very new to AWS and recently got 12 months free in the cloud while using Udemy to get some basic concepts down. 

So, here is what happened, I was learning how to use the IAM tool to add groups and users as well as permissions to each user within the groups I had created, I created a fake Information Technology group and added myself and a few dummy users in another fake group then added tags so i was easier to find. The stupid thing was...I used the same username and password I would have used for my user account (rookie mistake I know) and went to the login link for the fake me i had created with the AWSadmin permission for the dummy account. Everything was great until the instructor told me to delete the dummy user and now when i log back into my root account on my AWS server I am unable to add myself, users, or any kind of group. I also guess i changed my password so now I have to use the dummy password to login to my root account. 

The error message I get is : ""user/(blank) is not authorized to perform: iam:GetAccountSummary on resource"". I used blank so that I do not give out any of my cloud information 

I am both p\*ssed and laughing at myself because this should be a simple concept and somehow i messed it up ? am I just not logged into my root account by mistake ? I feel more at home with windows account management.

Language: English (Regional Setting: English)
Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600K CPU @ 3.40GHz (8 CPUs), ~3.4GHz
Memory: 8192MB RAM
Available OS Memory: 8160MB RAM
Page File: 5659MB used, 10692MB available
DirectX Version: DirectX 12

Graphics card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 Ti
Driver version: 23.21.13.9135 (NVIDIA 391.35)

Motherboard: ASUS P8P67 PRO
BIOS Date: 11/01/12 09:41:04 Ver: 36.02

PSU: Corsair TX750W


The issue:

Graphics-related. Issue seemed to start shortly after upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10 in August. The PC constantly freezes, sometimes with some artifacts on the monitor - hard disk continues to make noise for a while, fans continue to run, mouse doesn't respond to movements, num/caps lock lights on keyboard don't change on key press. Only fix is to hold power button and restart. Sometimes it automatically restarts, but usually not. Sometimes this happens on the sign in page for Windows 10 (there are usually a few prominent bright pixels at the top of the screen, followed by a freeze), sometimes it will load Windows and will work for a short time. The test image in NVIDIA control panel has artifacts (black rectangles), but typically settle after 10 seconds or so. If it doesn't crash of its own accord, I can make it crash by running a PCIe render test in GPU-Z, or by doing literally anything else for about 3 minutes.

The machine will run at length (numerous days) without crashing if i disable the display adaptor from device manager. There is some occasional audio stuttering if I do so.

Things I have tried to fix it:

* cleaned some dust from the case and from the dust filters on the case fans - no improvement (and I don't think temps were an issue anyway)
* removed the card, cleaned some dust from it with compressed air (carefully), reseated it. Same with the 2x 4GB RAM sticks - no improvement
* have run system file checker dozens of times (a couple of times, months ago, it has found and fixed errors, but I wondered if that wasn't due to the continuous hard resetting of the machine after a crash)
* ran full virus scan with Defender and Malwarebytes - no issues
* check disk utility run numerous times - no issues
* run the Windows memory diagnostic test for a few short cycles and two longer ones (overnight) - no issues. Haven't used a commercial memtest.
* uninstalled all display drivers with DDU and reinstalled in various ways, manually via the NVIDIA website, via GeForce Experience and by letting Windows Update do whatever it wants - no improvement
* Used an older driver that Windows Update wanted to use and not the latest  NVIDIA
recommended one - no improvement
* Intel Driver Assistant has no updates for me to install
* turned off quick boot - no improvement
* disabled all non-Microsoft drivers - no improvement
* flashed motherboard and video BIOSes - no improvement
* reset Windows - no improvement
* downloaded a Windows installation media from Microsoft and performed a fresh reinstall with new partitions - twice - improvement the first time (for about 36 hours) before the problem reappeared, no change the second time

Other issues which I am not sure are related, but you guys would know better than me:

* the driver for my CPU fan has been disabled in device manager (code 22), but seems to be working anyway - and causes a blue screen (Page Fault in Non-Paged Area) when i enable it. (As far as I can tell, all the entries in my dump file are to do with this - nothing useful about the more general problem, I guess because it just crashes rather than blue screens and doesn't write a file). Think this is a recent issue as it was fine until a couple of weeks ago.
* A couple of days ago (and this was a one off) the PC shut down when i was AFK and when I came back and restarted, fans ran but during POST there was a red LED on the motherboard by the memory slots. I checked they were seated properly and after a couple of further restarts the problem went away (fingers crossed) - has not happened before or since.

Am self-isolating because of the 'rona, so can't get easily hold of another card to see if it works, and can't test my card in another machine.

Rapidly running out of ideas - anyone have any thoughts before I bite the bullet and buy a new card? The only thing stopping me is that this was never an issue with Windows 7 (pre-August), but i think it worked pretty much fine for the first couple of weeks after upgrading, so am guessing it's just a coincindence.

"I built an Opiplex 990 gaming PC for my friend. I've built my own PC and i run Manjaro linux, so i'd consider myself fairly knowledgeable on this sort of stuff, but i need some help. Sounds cocky, i know.

Specs: (Not the best CPU or amount of ram, i know)

* i5-2400.
* GTX 770.
* 8Gb ram.
* 250gb SSD.
* 1TB ancient hard drive that came with the Optiplex.
* 500w power supply (Possibly not enough? Still, it crashes even if it isn't using much power).

The issue:

His PCs screen will freeze, go black, and then turn on again.

In Event Viewer, he gets nvlddmkm error event 14.

When: (These are rather strange)

1. Logging into discord causes his PC to freeze entirely and need a full reboot.
2. *It does NOT* crash when he plays CS:GO, strangely. Eliminates power issues for the most part.
3. Moving mouse around quickly.
4. When first turning the system on.
5. Crashes on youtube, but it takes a while.

NOTE: The fans still spin when it crashes.

Possibilities not proven likely or unlikely:

* Faulty graphics card
* Incorrect motherboard voltages
* Problematic PSU
* Incorrect memory timings or voltages
* Bad PCI-E slot
* Bad memory or GPU clocks

Possibilities proven very unlikely:

* Overheating (it crashes when cool and on startup).
* Corrupt driver install (Uninstalled and reinstalled).
* loose power cables or not in slot all the way (I had him press everything in and even swap the positions of the cables and such. strangely, discord didn't completely destroy his computer when he logged in, but i don't think it worked or something).

I asked him if he was comfortable with moving the graphics card to the second slot, and he said he wasn't. I'll probably go over to his house sometime or have him do it anyway.

" 

What fps am i supposed to run gta v at with a rtx 2070 and an i5 9400f because I don't think it's an average of 70 to 80 in story mode and an average of 50 to 60 in online mode with drops to even 30.

My biggest concern is that when I initially installed gta on my 3 month old rig it ran on a capped 144 in story with a few drops online to just 120, letting me no room for understanding of the downgrade.

In both times I played gta I had everything maxed out on 1080p. I observed some bottleneck issues at some point when the GPU was using only 60% to 70% but today the usage went fine to a degree. I heard gta may be cpu intensive but the cpu wasn't working too hard either ( around 50 % ). 

In adition to that I encountered a sort of horizontal flickering of translucid lines constantly going up. Another issue that could be related to the monitor is a weird occurance of small formations of black dots. These ones I encountered in rdr 2 when disabling taaand looking at the sun and in witcher 3 when looking at bright textures such as snow. Now I don't know if this issue is gpu or monitor related. It's a 4 year old monitor but i find it hard to believe a monitor would go bad.

I started updating all the drivers but it did not help. I reset the windows to a restore point from 2 days prior and the error still persisted.

While trying to find some solution, it started throwing Bad\_Config\_Info and would not open. It also did not open in safe mode. I reset it again to that restore point and all worked fine for 10 minutes until another KMod Exception BSOD came.

I unplugged the CMOS battery, GPU and RAM just to be sure. When ram was in position 2 and 4, it opened and gave the KMod Exception, when I moved the ram into the 1 and 3 position, the debug light indicated that the CPU was not detected and it failed to post. After moving back, it opened.

I decided to create a windows setup usb and reinstall windows. It reinstalled but it again started throwing the KMod Exception.

Also, not sure if important but Task Manager started showing weird CPU details, like 9967711.83 GHz and always 100% utilization. The problem persisted in core temp but in the Ryzen Master app it was fine.

Edit: After trying to reverse the RAM again, it posted. It fails to post at random times.

Tried  to flush the static (hold down the power button for \~45 second &lt; tried with all possible combinations w/ or w/out the plug w/ or w/out the battery&gt;). However accidentally I've unplugged the track pad from the MB and this time it had video output. When I've connected the TP back and tried to boot again the video was out again. I tried something (I don't know if it's stupid or not) but when I had the video output on I've connected the TP ( with the laptop on) and it don't crash on the contrary I had both video output and a TP. I've re-installed windows (and it went through multiple restarts) and everything looked promising so far...that until I've turned off my laptop and tried to power it back on the next day... guess who was back?

"Hi,

I just bought a Hisense Q8 65"" and am loving it. I've noticed tha since setting it up, my Apple devices (A 2015 Macbook Pro 13"" Retina, iPad Pro, and iPhone XR) say they have an option to mirror to an Apple TV called ""living room"" It was my understanding that this TV didn't have Airplay and I don't have an Apple TV hooked up to it, so I do not know where this is coming from. Whenever I try to cast to it, it asks for a code, and I do not know which app on the TV to get this from. I have tried the TV app 'Anyview Cast' with no luck. I also tried Hisense support but that left a lot to be desired. I do not know where this 'Living room' comes from, I believe it is the TV (though it's still there even when the TV is off) and I don't think it can be the neighbours or anything can it?

As title says I do have an old LGA 1150 motherboard.

This is what happened: I have bought an NVME drive for my PC, knowing that it dies not support it, I have also bought a PCIe x4 extension card 

[&gt; Extension Card &lt;](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JJTVGZM/)


I am aware that the motherboard does not have an x4 slot, but I figured I could just use  the x16 slot instead.


Upon installing the card and NVME, only BIOS recognized it, windows did not do anything.

I have downloaded the driver from Samsung's website and  tried to install it. I
After around 30 minutes it was not finished.

Another 90 minutes have passed and nothing happened still, so I have tried to restart the PC normally. It hang on ""restarting"" screen for eternity as well,  so, after  almost 5 hours I have reset it via the button.


Windows is in continuous BSOD loop if I have the NVME installed. BIOS continues to recognize it without any issue, although driver info menu option is disabled  in the menu.

The BSOD is ""Critical Service Failed"", and keeps rebooting.

Once it hits ""Automatic Repair"", it never loads either.

Tried many things involving installing the card after AR finished loading without it (installed it carefully while in the menu before the restart), then selecting no signature enforcement...same issue.


If you look at the Motherboard's picture


The 

WHITE slot has my video card

BROWN slot has my expansion card

BLACK slot is empty (also tried extension card here, same outcome)


* I have re-seated the expansion card multiple times, and BIOS always recognizes it. 

* I have also tried to reset it to default settings, no dice

* I have tried to disable all entries of the NVME drive boot options 

* the driver does not show up on installed programs or device manager

* taking out the NVME card makes windows boot normally without fail

"I've had my computer for a little over a year and recently reapplied the GPU thermal paste. However, after reinserting my GPU the computer will not boot. All of the fans spin, everything lights up, and any peripherals get power. The red LED indicating something is wrong with the CPU on the motherboard is solid whenever the computer is powered on. Nothing gets displayed whenever the computer is on. The GPU was the only thing I messed with before the computer stopped working.

Things I've tried:
-Booting the PC with no GPU and a different GPU.
-Using each different HDMI/Display Port on the GPU and motherboard.
-Using different monitors.
-Clearing the CMOS.
-Making sure everything on the motherboard is plugged in correctly.

Hi there,

Looking for some help with my Alienware 17 R4, getting hopeless. Although I've made slight improvements with things like changing options in bios, throttlestop disabling BD PROCHOT, undervolting, changing power management percentage, monitoring temps and usuage using mwinfo etc etc etc. So It appears when I clock my 2.8ghz to 3.5-3.6ghz I get the same performance in HEAVEN benchmark as when it's at 2.8, except my temps get up to over 90 degrees celcius. So that's why I put my power management down to 85-90%, and my temps remain in the 80s, and my performance is very similar.

I don't quite seem to be getting the same performance I use to be getting while gaming (warzone and pubg).

Just today I ran LatencyMon and noticed I Was getting some really high numbers, so I disabled a couple dell drivers and seen the battery ACPI was giving me high numbers so I disabled that. That seemed to improve performance slightly, but doing all this seems like its just a bandage to my situation and I'm not resolving the root cause. Considering I use to get much better performance, I'm not sure what it could be.

My 17 R4 specs are as followed;  
AMD Radeon(TM) RX 570 with 8GB GDDR5  
16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 at 2400MHz  
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ (Q uad-Core, 6MB Cache, up to 3.8 GHz w/ Turbo Boost)

"Hey Everyone, 

I've recently built my first PC! It's been running smoothly with the exception of one issue. There's a seemingly random issue where my devices (keyboard, mouse, etc.) will stop working and my monitor will lose signal shortly thereafter. However by simply unplugging and plugging back in the the (Monitor) HDMI cable to the GPU the issue is resolved. It may seem like a non-issue but it's extremely annoying. I also stream and play games and it would suck for this to happen in the middle of that.

Sometimes it will happen a couple times when running my PC, sometimes it won't happen at all. It's extremely random. I'm also not doing anything that would stress my components out. I'll play Total War Warhammer II on high/ultra settings for hours and be fine but I'll be reading something on Google or watching a YouTube video and this issue will occur. I have tried to look up answers to this issue on forums but I can't seem to find any solutions.

"My girlfriend and I are interested in sharing a monitor, wireless keyboard and mouse between our two laptops. We have Acer laptops purchased over the last 8 or so years... Is it possible to share the monitor and externals with minimal wire switching? We wouldn't mind multiple docking stations if needed, but we are hoping for something a little more elegant for the mouse and keyboard versus swapping the receiver every time we work.

Is there a single docking station solution that works for 2 laptops? Is this something that needs two separate stations? I'm having a tough time visualizing how this might come together.

"I have a decent pair of headphones I've been using for a year or so, and they have solid bass response which I like. I used them without any problems for a while, but lately I've been having a glitchy issue with the plug. They're still usable, but sometimes it's just annoying and  I'm wondering if there's some type of fix.

When I use them on my phone, sometimes the audio cuts out halfway and you have to fiddle with the plug, either by pushing it harder into the jack (though it's already fully plugged in), or slowly rotating it while pressing it. Once you get a solid connection it's fine, as long you don't disturb it.

It's a similar issue using them on my laptop. Most of the time the audio will be halfway cut out until you keep rotating/pressing and you find that sweet spot. Once I get a solid connection I'll actually put something on top of the wire a few inches away from the jack, just so there's no incidental movement at the plug. 

What do you guys think -- is the plug just on its way out at this point, or maybe fixable?",causing plug pair headphone glitchy connection multiple device decent pair headphone using year solid bass response used problem lately glitchy plug usable annoying wondering type fix use phone audio cut halfway fiddle plug pushing harder jack fully plugged slowly rotating pressing solid connection fine long disturb similar using laptop time audio halfway cut rotating pressing sweet spot solid connection actually wire inch away jack incidental movement plug guy think plug way point maybe fixable,0
"Hello 

A friend gave me an msi 970 gaming edition mobo, fx8350 cpu 
And a cooler master 120mm aio.

I and an old graphics card laying around and I plugged that in.

All I needed was a case and power supply.
I purchased a 600 watt 80+ gold corsair power supply at micro center
I bought a new power supply and a used atx case 


On initial boot everything worked fine, temps a bit high 50c but they were dropping, so I turned it off, hooked up a few hard drives and went booted up Ubuntu server. At first it hitched with a 99 in the bottom right corner, then went into the os.

One thing to note is that the vrm cooler was almost too hot to touch - could this have been the problem?

Then after another reboot it got frozen with the 99 in the bottom right corner. 
I tried restarting it, unplugging unused usb ports, resetting the ram, booting with a single ram stick, using a different pcie slot for the graphics card, unplugging the hard drives from the mobo. Nothing works.

Now the pc powers on, the screen flickers I see the 99 error code and the pc shuts off

"Hi There,

I've recently been experiencing fairly constant BSODs. It's generally when gaming (WoW) and will occur early into a session - i.e. 15-20 minutes. My PC will then BSOD on startup multiple times and I need to continue rebooting. I usually need to continuously reboot, open the game I'm trying to play for about an hour. Eventually, it will allow me to play games including WoW for hours with no BSODs. 

The next day this will repeat. It seems that if the PC is off for more than a few hours this BSOD loop resets.

The BSOD error messages include a (seemingly random) assortment of:

SYSTEM SERVICE EXCEPTION  
KMODE EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED  
KERNEL SECURITY CHECK FAILURE  
PAGE FAULT IN NONPAGED AREA  
DRIVER IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL

and there are a variety of drivers/modules that the BSOD specifies, including unknown(0x0000), ntoskrnl.exe and partmgr.sys.

I've tried pretty much everything I can find online including Memtest (all night no issues), CHKDSK, DISM, SFC Scannow, BIOS Update, dislodging memory/GPU and relodging, all windows updates.

I can't specify any drivers that are causing the issue.

This indicates that an exception happened while executing a routine that  transitions from non-privileged code to privileged code.   
This appears to be  a typical software driver bug and is not likely to be caused by a hardware  problem.

"I recently upgraded my RAM from 2x8GB to 4x8GB. I bought 4 new sticks of Corsair (CMK16GX4M2B3000C15). When I initially installed it, I was able to see all 32GB available in Task Manager. As part of some other cleanup I was doing, I then reinstalled Windows. I also played around with the DRAM timings and frequency, with the default XMP profile but after it failed to post with that I reset it to default. I don't know when exactly the behavior started, whether it was after the XMP tweaking or the windows reinstall. But now both the BIOS and Windows itself detects only 16GB available. CPU-Z also detects 32GB available.

* OS: Windows 10 Home Edition

* Trying each stick one at a time
* Trying the sticks 2 at a time in alternating DIMM slots (1,3-&gt;2,4)
* Trying 3 sticks in slots 1,2,4and 2,3,4 (Still only detected 16GB)
* Updating BIOS to latest
* Updating chipset drivers
* Updating Nvidia drivers
* Clearing CMOS (Removed battery and shorted the jumper)
* Reseating CPU and checking for bent pins (none)

*Please note that this isn't a new build. I built this in 2015 and it has been running with zero issues prior today.*

###Troubleshooting Help:

**What is your parts list? [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp)**

Built by myself several years ago...

* CPU: Intel i5 4690k
* CPU Cooler: Corsair water cooled (don't remember exact model)
* Motherboard: ASUS Z97-AR
* GPU: AMD R9 390
* PSU: EVGA NEX750B
* RAM: 4x 4GB DDR3

**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

I was browsing the web and my PC froze. I had to hard-shutdown. Now it won't turn on. When pressing the power button, the fans (PSU fan and CPU case fan) spin for about a half second, the nothing. A second or two later it does it again. This keep repeating over and over until I turn off the power supply.

**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

* Performed power supply paper clip test - succeeded, so I don't think the power supply is at fault. Issue resumed when I plugged the power supply ATX cable back into the mobo.
* Unplugged basically everything from the mobo in an attempt to isolate the issue to another part
  * Disconnected all peripherals
  * Removed sound card
  * Disconnected hard drives
  * Disconnected GPU
  * Removed RAM - also tested with only one stick in slot 1
* Tried various power outlets
* Tested with new mobo CMOS battery


**Post relevant photos of build/parts here.**

[Imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/dIXC0GR) with video of the issue. [Direct link](https://i.imgur.com/6fMKpGu.mp4) in case that doesn't work.

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

I suspect my mobo is dead due to the successful PSU paper clip test. I'm just a little confused as to why the mobo power light stays on.

Either that or a random short somewhere. The short seems unlikely though considering my PC doesn't ever really move. 

Maybe a CPU issue? I'm not really sure what to debug there.

I've also never had any issues since I built this in 2015.

"I've recently noticed that the temps of my CPU skyrocket to 80-90C° some time after booting my computer and go back down to around 35-40C° once I open the task manager (note that when I open task manager, the CPU usage is at 100%, but it freezes for a second and then goes back to whatever percentage it was before).

Also, I've noticed that idle temps are often around the 35-40 mark, which is weird cause those are the same temps I get when I'm browsing on Chrome or doing Zoom meetings. Whenever I'm working with a more consuming software such as Cubase or Photoshop, the temps don't usually go above 60. Is this normal or should I be preoccupied?

Also also, is it possible that it's a thermal paste/stock cooler problem, or could it be something more practical like dust or poor air flow?

The issue is with the audio/sound system I'm trying to connect to the whole setup. I bought a Optical SWITCH, which is connected to a Logitech Z-5500. Input 1 is connected to one of the televisions and Input 2 is connected to the other. The sound system works great with the LG 55UH850V but doesn't work with the LG OLED55CX6. 

I have tried different inputs and made sure to check which input is active on the optical switch. I also made sure to check the settings on both tv's. Both tv's were on Optical output. I checked both optical cables. **Also most important, when connecting the LG OLED55CX6 directly to my Logitech Z-5500 with the same optical cable it works fine.** 

Side note: I ofcourse checked to see if the LG 55UH850V was turned off, if it would work but sadly no. 

Anyone have any clue why the LG OLED55CX6 is having issues passing through the audio to the switch? ",lg oled optical audio help hey guy owner brand new lg oled55cx6 running audio problem hopefuly right place question diagram connecting nvidia shield hdmi 2 0 splitter connected lg tv's lg 55uh850v lg oled55cx6 work great issue whatsoever audio sound trying connect setup bought optical switch connected logitech z 5500 input 1 connected television input 2 connected sound work great lg 55uh850v work lg oled55cx6 tried different input sure check input active optical switch sure check setting tv's tv's optical output checked optical cable important connecting lg oled55cx6 directly logitech z 5500 optical cable work fine note ofcourse checked lg 55uh850v turned work sadly clue lg oled55cx6 issue passing audio switch,0
"My laptop has been having some major display problems. On startup, the base loading screen pops up but when it tries to go to the windows login a black screen with white dots along the bottom pops up. These dots move across the screen for ten seconds then freeze, nothing else happens. 

I’ve tried resetting by taking the battery out and I’ve attempted to reinstall windows but on one of the restarts during the reinstall, the black screen comes back 

This is the second time this issue has occurred for me and reinstalling windows solved it the first time a few months ago so I’m not sure what’s different now. 

The physical display works because I’ve launched in safe mode and gotten to my login page but nothing after the black screen pops up will effect it. This problem could be tied to Nvidia as I was trying to install a new driver update for Borderlands 3 and went to bed after it was done, and the problem started this morning. The driver update was Nvidia 457.30

"Hey guys! I've been experiencing these two bsod stop codes lately and I'm starting to run out of ideas as to how to fix them. I really hope you guys could help me with this. 

Fixes that I've tried so far:

1. ""sfc /scannow"" in cmd
2. DDU'd my GPU's drivers and reinstalled them
3. Reseated my ram
4. Ran the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool (nothing came up here)
5. Ran DISM Commands

Unfortunately I'm still crashing even after those three.

These modules were also identified to be crashing my pc lately:

" The other day I noticed all my USB devices stopped working (mouse, keyboard, etc). I had to unplug and re plug them all into my PC.

No big deal until today when I went to go change my RGB in Cam and I realized now that none of my RGB devices are showing up in CAM. Instead it says ""No supported lighting devices found"".

Has this happened to anyone before? I assumed it was related to the USB issue so I tried unplugging all the cables on the NZXT Hue + and where the cooler connects to the MOBO. I think I found all the right cables to re-plug but it still won't show up in CAM.

I've tried re-installing CAM about 5 times now with no luck.

I unfortunately had someone build this PC for me so I'm not that familiar with the ins and outs of all the cables inside of it.

Is there a specific cable I should be looking to unplug? As far as I know I did try and replug the USB connection on the MOBO as well as re seating all the cables that plug into the HUE+.

I'm getting real sad because I can't find any solution and the Z63 screen isn't really working. Just showing a black/white reading of the liquid temps.


Edit: I was able to solve the problem by following a YouTube tutorial. I believe I just needed to use a program like Revo uninstaller to wipe any files from NZXT because once I did that and reinstalled CAM it seemed to finally work.

"I bought the D6000 docking station to connect dual external monitors and be able to switch those and my peripherals between a Dell Latitude 5490 I will be using at home for work, and my personal laptop, a 7 year old Asus N56V. 

After installing the DisplayLink software on my Asus, none of the peripherals or monitors attached to the docking station are detected in Windows. There has been an endless loop of the notification sounds of a USB device being plugged in, then disconnected, but never does it seem that the dock itself is detected. The firmware updater also does not detect the D6000 (I assume that's dependent on Windows detection, anyway).

There is a small LED at the front of the dock that is orange/red when plugged into the non-charging USB 3.0 ports, but it does turn white when plugged into the charging USB 3.0 port on the Asus. It's clear this is the one port I'd have to use with this laptop, but I haven't made any further progress. Restarts, disconnecting/reconnecting power and peripherals has not worked. 

I thought I would be able to use the D6000 without software on the Latitude 5490, but it seems DisplayLink is needed for this device, too. So far I've only seen that when plugging in the dock via USB-C, it must be sending power because the screen brightens up, but the light on the dock never changes to white, and none of the periperals or monitors are detected, either. I'd still have to get an administrator at work to install the DisplayLink software, but if I can't get the D6000 dock running with my personal laptop, it would defeat the purpose of having it in the first place.

My problem is when I install it, both fans will turn on but I will be unable to boot. The PC will also instantly turn off if I press the power button which, is quite abnormal.

My monitor also functions with the previous GPU in fact, I tried switching out monitors to make sure it wasn't a monitor issue and both did not work with the RX 550 but both did work with the previous GPU.

The strange thing that I didn't expect with the RX 550 was there is absolutely no 6 pin connector slot on it (or any slot at all) which, I suppose means it's trying to draw power directly from my motherboard which it's just not getting enough of which, means this isn't PSU related since it's not drawing power directly from the PSU?

"I have been having an issue on my PC in online games where I randomly will rubberband for a few seconds and then the game catches back up and is fine for a while. It seems everything is affected by it when these lag spikes hit. Every game seems to do it, Discord will do it, and any stream I am watching will also cut out. I would say it happens on average every 5-10 minutes, sometimes more, sometimes less. My roommate has 0 issues with this and is connected wirelessly to the same exact network. When the random lag spikes aren't happening I get perfect signal strength with the max speed that my ISP provides perfectly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are all of the things I have tried. And none of them have resolved my issue EXCEPT for directly hardwiring my computer to the router. That seems to fix all issues completely, however, due to certain circumstances the router is across the house and I don't want to run a cable from A to B if possible.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I tried my onboard WIFI adapter on my MoBo along with a Netgear Nighthawk adapter that I already owned.

\- I even bought another WiFi adapter to try in case mine was bad

\- I tried setting up QoS to help prioritize my computer

\- I even bought an entirely new $300 Nighthawk router

\- I went into power management on my PC and disabled the setting that allows your PC to cut power to your network adapter to conserve energy (seems like a silly setting)

\- I updated all of my drivers

\- I tried plugging in my WiFi adapter into different USB ports

&amp;#x200B;

I probably have tried even more than that throughout the several months that this has been happening but that is what comes to mind so far. No other devices in the house are having issues and I am definitely within a close enough range since everything else in the same room works perfectly.

"Hey, ok so i've been having this weird issue with my pc i built in January, since the beginning. On (every) boot the pc (so not just in-game) gets super laggy in sound and video, and sounds robotic. I, nor anyone else, have been able to figure out what the cause could be. I've tried just about anything i could google, but it was mostly advice on older slower systems, which is not my issue.

So the new clue in this mystery is that i ran HWiNFO64 to see if maybe there was a hardware issue i haven't found yet... and everything seems to be fine, but the kicker is, when i run the scan, the robot lag goes away immediately! Every time! So, what does this software do while scanning in order to solve the problem???My mind is boggled, i'm an amateur and this was my first build, and everything worked out great besides this weirdness.

Any thoughts are very welcome, whether it's having me test something or a brainstorming sesh. Sure i've been living with it for a year but i still really REALLY want to solve this lol. The damn thing even got the nickname the robot because it's been with me for so long.

"I have an LG TV (don't know much more about that but I have had it for several years if that helps). A few months ago when unplugging something out of the HDMI port, I went to plug something back in (sometimes go back and forth with FireStick and PS4) and I noticed the metal piece was missing. I'm not sure of exactly what caused it. It's possible I was just too rough, but it seemed like it just randomly happened.

In the meantime, I bought a splitter for my Cable, FireStick, and PS4 which is hooked into the second HDMI port. It works fine, but to switch between them, you have to physically press a button on the device. For lazy reasons, I would like to at least have the Cable to be it's own thing so I could switch back and forth with the remote.

From what I've been able to find, It seems like these are only sold to work with computers (found that out the hard way by buying something from Target that doesn't work with the television).

Does this thing exist? and is it reasonably priced? Any suggestions?

"A couple of minutes ago I experienced a somewhat concerning crash on my laptop. Everything was running buttery smooth until it suddenly made a loud ""poof"" and went black. No emergency shutdown or anything, it just went from running normally to entirely dead within less than a second, so the issue is most probably hardware related.

I'm using a Lenovo Y50-70 (running Windows 10) that I bought in April 2015 and used extensively since. Considering its age and how little care I take of it, the thing usually runs surprisingly well. Never had this problem before, in fact I can't even remember the last time I experienced any notable crashes. It might be worth mentioning that I played a game with 3D graphics when the crash happened, which is something I don't often do, so the system was under a bit more stress than usual.

After the crash I tried booting up again, but when pressing the power button, the indicator just lit up for a few seconds and then went dark again, seemingly without any intention of actually turning on. I let it rest for a minute or two before I tried again, and this time my laptop booted up just as if nothing ever happened. Didn't even get a notification telling me about the error. It has been running for roughly 30 minutes since then without giving me any trouble, but still I'm concerned since I kind of need a running computer these days.

So what do you guys think caused this problem, will it happen again, possibly causing permanent damage and if so would there be any way for me to fix it? To be honest I never replaced my laptops thermal paste and can't remember cleaning the fans either, so maybe it could have been heat-related? From the outside my laptop didn't feel too hot though, just a little more than usual. 

I was thinking about building my first desktop PC in a year or maybe two, but possibly I should consider doing that a lot sooner now?

"Hi there internet citizen! 

Apologies in advance for the long-winded rant but I have exhausted the extent of corporate overlord sanctioned tech support scripting and have failed to resolve my issue. The following is not meant as a criticism of any brands or companies mentioned, and I must offer my commendation for the friendly customer service representatives I spoke to, but whilst they were well-intentioned, they were ultimately unhelpful.

In a nutshell, I have purchased and installed three fairly recent games on Steam - games that my system can run well.  My first problem was that I had to run these games through Origin; EA won't let Valve run their games through the Steam client, so whenever I try to launch it through Steam it automatically opens the Origin client. This in itself wouldn't be more than a minor inconvenience, except that the Origin client will NOT recognise the game clearly installed on my harddrive. Because it is installed through Steam, the Origin client seems to think I still need to download the game, yet trying to then download the game through Origin results in one of two scenarios:

1) If not yet installed, will force install the game through Steam.

2) If already installed, says that the game could not be downloaded and to try again. 

So, running the game presents me with this unusual and insurpassable obstacle. I explained my dilemma to an EA rep who guided me through the standard uninstall/re-install procedures and some basic troubleshooting. Predictably, this did nothing except delay me further as after uninstalling the game I had to wait three days for it to download again (thank the australian internet for that). 

Eventually another EA rep helped me get one step further by guiding me through how to fix issues on STEAMS end... He advised that I should clear my download cache and repair the library folders on the Steam client, which I did. I then loaded everything back up again and SUCCESS(!) Origin no longer recognises that the game is not installed! It now just refuses to play it at all. Every time I click play it ... does nothing? Starts doing a first time set up (through steam) and then just.... nothing. Resets the Origin client and takes me back to their home page and that's it? 

I also reached out to Steam support for help but they told me that they weren't able to help - basically said I had to speak to EA or get a refund (despite me trying to get a refund in the past and being rejected because the aforementioned slow internet caused me to not finish downloading these games until their refund period had expired... this isnt the case for all of them, I am generalising, but still... i reached out for a solution, not a shoulder shrug). Makes me wonder why I can even purchase these games through Steam at all? 

If anyone has experienced this same problem and can offer a more helpful solution I would be immensely grateful - even if you haven't been able to fix it, at least I can feel validated in that it is not just me. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Origin forces game to be installed via Steam, Steam forces game to be played via Origin.

Otherwise the board wont boot?

Has anyone ran into similar AIO install issues?

I'm having issues charging my battery. I have a Clevo WS650J. It will run just fine with no battery (AC only). It will also operate on battery power only. However, the battery does no charge when AC power is plugged in. I have tried three new batteries from different sources and it refuses to charge them. When plugged in to AC power, the battery does not discharge, but does not charge either. Oddly, if I leave it plugged into AC overnight in sleep mode, in the morning it will state 100% charged. But when the AC is removed, it goes back to the level it was at the previous day (i.e. it hasn't charged at all). I have updated all drivers (and tried removing/reinstalling the battery drivers) and even updated the BIOS. I have tried different AC adapters with the same result. I have also tried booting into Ubuntu via USB and the result is the same. I've had a quick look inside and nothing seems obviously broken or damaged. I'm out of ideas!  Currently it's acting as a desktop PC since I only have the 39% already in the battery to use without AC power.

The windows battery tray doesn’t offer much [(picture 1)](https://i.imgur.com/NP5wQJL.png). When hovered over, it says ""(plugged in)"". It does not state ""(plugged in, not charging)"", or ""(plugged in, charging)"".

BatteryInfoView and BatteryMon claim it’s ‘charging’ but at a rate of 0mW. They report the voltage and current capacity correctly it seems [(picture 2)](https://i.imgur.com/SdEVhpa.png).

"External Hard Drive Suggestions

Hey there,

Lately I’ve been looking to buy a external hard drive for my mother since the hard drive on her MacBook has been nearing capacity. I was wondering if anyone had some suggestions for what could be a good 1-2 TB external hard drive option. I was thinking of buying a Lacie rugged 1tb, or a WD 2tb My passport, because I own one for my personal backups and like it, but I’m not sure if it’s a drive that you could use for more that just backing up files (I want an external where you can use it as if it were a internal drive in the computer already). Could these drives be plugged in constantly for editing the documents and photo stored on the drive?

Any tips?

"Hello Everyone

Short story, I'm trying to configure WoL and WoW, but the last one isn't working with the computer turned off because the router doesn't save the binding between the IP and the MAC of the PC, and there is no way to set a static ARP, except by doing root and installing a new GUI.

At this point I have two ideas:  
\- Change the modem/router: no way for now, I should reconfigure the IPs of too many devices between PCs and printers of my father and his colleague  
\- Set a device that is always on, through which I can send the magic packet via LAN, and not via internet: Raspberry (sending a command via SSH), a mini PC to access maybe with TeamViewer, or some other device.

Did someone else find himself in this situation? Do you have any other idea how to solve the problem, or maybe you can suggest me some other device to use as an intermediary, that I didn't think about (and that maybe I could have around, without having to buy a Raspberry)?

Thank you all in advance!

"I recently bought a Samsung U28R554 Monitor. I‘m on a Hackintosh running Catalina, but I’m pretty sure it’s a hardware problem, so maybe just ignore it’s running MacOS. 

Problem: 

When I switched from my 23’‘ FullHD Apple Cinema fisplay to the aforementioned 28‘‘ 4K one, it works fine for about 5 minutes. Then it suddenly only turns green. No flickering, just solid green. The monitors menu was still displayed on top everything just fine. 
I used the same port on my Mac with both displays, the monitor and cable work fine with my 2019 MacBook Pro and the Cinema Display still works (after rebooting). 

This happens every time I put any kind of load on the GPU. The iGPU settings are on Automatic. 


Similar issues I found online were apparently caused by a PSU with not enough Power. I don’t think that‘s the problem, since I could play games on the old Monitor and not even watch FHD Videos on the new one.

"I have a PC to TV connection that works fine on short passive HDMI 2.0 cables, but all longer cables I've tried fail with either no signal, or cutting out frequently ([original post for context](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/jz4oe1/video_connection_solution_for_pc_to_tv_4k_60hz/)). 

While looking for a solve, I've received several suggestions. I'm not sure which one is the right one to pursue (and why). 

Suggestions have been:

* CAT6-based HDMI extender ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiovisual/comments/k0jp15/is_this_hdmi_extender_cat6_combo_viable_for_30ft/), or this [transmitter](https://www.crestron.com/Products/Video/HDMI-Solutions/HDMI-Extenders/HD-TX-101-C-E)/[receiver](https://www.crestron.com/Products/Video/HDMI-Solutions/HDMI-Extenders/HD-RX-101-C-E) combo)
* ~$200 active hybrid fiber/copper HDMI cable ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiovisual/comments/k0jp15/is_this_hdmi_extender_cat6_combo_viable_for_30ft/gdiyjo5/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiovisual/comments/k0jp15/is_this_hdmi_extender_cat6_combo_viable_for_30ft/gdk41cf/)). Note that I did try [this](https://www.club-3d.com/en/detail/2436/hdmi_2.0_4k60hz_redmere_cable_10m-32.81ft/) active cable already but it didn't work. 
* Shielded HDMI cable ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiovisual/comments/k0jp15/is_this_hdmi_extender_cat6_combo_viable_for_30ft/gdj1bim/) - not sure what this even means)
* Powered HDMI switch ([here](https://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-Blackbird-HDMI-Slim-Switch/dp/B01BOB6T4E]))

I don't mind spending a bit of money here - but if I pursued them all it'd run me like $1000, just to hook up my PC to my TV over a 30 foot distance. 

Which of these suggestions should I pursue first? And ideally for my own learning, why?

"The more I look into this, the less likely it seems to be possible for my setup, but I want a second opinion on what to try. 

**The Problem**
My brother and I love playing civ and we have played a lot of civ 5 and 6 together. However, his PC can barely run civ 6. His experience is heavily impacted by poor performance, and he is probably damaging his laptop when he plays.

**Boring/Expensive Solutions**
Obviously we could play hot-seat mode, or choose not to play, or buy him a new machine, or get some commercial cloud gaming service. I don't want to do these.

**The Plan**
I have a relatively beefy PC, and I want to run two instances of the game using my hardware, so we can both play at the same time. I am pretty certain from a pure hardware standpoint that the performance would be good. I have an NVidia RTX 2060 and an AMD Ryzen 5 3600X plus plenty of ram, running Windows 10. I can run civ 5 and 6 at the same time very easily, but as far as I know, steam does not support running multiple instances of any one game.

**What I Have Tried**
I tried creating a linux (Ubuntu) virtual machine using *VMware Workstation 16*. I installed steam and civ 6 on that VM, in the hopes that my brother could log in and stream the game to his laptop using that steam game streaming feature. I had to enable virtualization for my cpu in the bios, and I had some issues managing the storage for the vm, but I was able to get past those issues. This was going well until I actually tried to run the game and realized that VMware workstation did not allow for any GPU to be allocated to the VM. 

**The Question**
I have been looking for other free VM tools that could be used to create a virtual machine with a GPU. It looks like *vSphere Hypervisor* could be used for something like this, but I haven't tried it yet.

* Does this seem feasible?
* Would it even be possible to use the GPU for both the VM and the host machine at the same time?
* Is there some other way to run two instances on the same hardware (and allow for separate control inputs)?

Any other tips or experience sharing would also be appreciated.",allocate gpu used vm host time look likely possible setup want second opinion try problem brother love playing civ played lot civ 5 6 barely run civ 6 experience heavily impacted poor performance probably damaging laptop play boring expensive solution obviously play hot seat mode choose play buy new machine commercial cloud gaming service want plan relatively beefy want run instance game using hardware play time pretty certain pure hardware standpoint performance good nvidia rtx 2060 amd ryzen 5 3600x plus plenty ram running window 10 run civ 5 6 time easily far know steam support running multiple instance game tried tried creating linux ubuntu virtual machine using vmware workstation 16 installed steam civ 6 vm hope brother log stream game laptop using steam game streaming feature enable virtualization cpu bios issue managing storage vm able past issue going actually tried run game realized vmware workstation allow gpu allocated vm question looking free vm tool used create virtual machine gpu look vsphere hypervisor used tried feasible possible use gpu vm host machine time way run instance hardware allow separate control input tip experience sharing appreciated,0

I booted it up and it showed the BSoD with the error ""Stop Code: VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE ~ What failed: amdkmdag.sys""

Since then, the computer hasn't been able to boot up at all. It shows the error ""stop code: 0xc00021a"" I can't boot the computer up into safe mode, it won't let me reset it, I've tried reseting bios and running the diagnostics tool but they all fail.

"hi! for years i've been having an issue while gaming where my character will randomly start moving in one direction, as if i'm pressing the related arrow key. it both starts randomly and seems to stop randomly (i.e. i haven't found a way to fix it; i just have to wait it out). 

so for example, if i'm playing GTA San Andreas, Carl will suddenly act like i'm pressing one of the arrow keys (it's a different direction every time), and won't stop moving in that direction for a while. the same continues when i open up the game menu; i.e. it just endlessly scrolls thru each option in whatever direction the bug is happening that time. this has happened in other games too, but it's never happened outside of a game. it also doesn't matter whether i'm using the WASD direction keys or the arrows. for info, all games are legit, and i'm playing on a 2011 macbook with no accessories, and have never used any.

"Hang with me here on this one.....I tried to explain with details so I apologize for the length.

So I moved out of state a few weeks ago.  I signed up for ATT Fiber internet and had it installed.  Rather than setting up all my old devices on the new ATT wifi network, I just plugged my Google wi-fi into the new ATT router.  All of my devices connected just fine and worked just fine, so I thought I was good to go.  A few days later my neighbor asked where we moved from (she knew the general area).  She then **proceeded to tell me that all of her Apple devices have locations showing up at MY exact same old address!!??**  I was stumped.  

I tried rebooting several times, but nothing worked - so I figured I would do a hard reset.  But instead I just decided to see if I removed my Google Wifi, if it would revert back.  It did - my neighbor said just after I removed my google wifi everything was back to normal.  

One useful fact:  I believe we share the same ATT box and we both do have ATT internet service.  

This feels like a major security issue and I figured I should let someone know.  Google?  Apple?   
 ATT?  If I had just moved across town, the neighbor would have though that someone kidnapped her son because of his wrong location tracking.  The fact it showed he was 5 states away made it unbelievable to her and then she put two and two together and realized it was showing near the area I said we moved from.   I searched online for explanations but came up empty, so I am contacting all of your techies for answers.  

What should I do next?  I am just fine leaving it alone as the ATT wifi works just fine and I already connected all my new devices.  But this seemed too much of an issue....I feel like I have to say something.

"Hello all, weird problem with my pc yesterday. I'll try to remember everything as it happened in order, after describing what I think is relevant in my setup.

Windows 10 PC, Radeon R9 200 series gpu. HDMI goes from GPU to my Insignia TV, a Logitech 2.1 sound system is plugged into the 3.5mm audio out from the TV. It has worked well until yesterday.

I downloaded the latest Runescape directly from their website, once I started it I could hear the intro music or whatever you'd call it. It wanted to configure my settings based off my system, then it says my graphics driver is out of date. Almost surely true, since I've got it set to not update automatically. I downloaded the update straight from [AMD.com](https://AMD.com). It's now version 20.9.1. After getting that set up I decided not to play and went to Youtube. That's when I first noticed the no sound problem.It will play sound if I plug the speakers directly into the rear 3.5mm jack, but not the front jack which has worked before now.

I've reinstalled the AMD driver, went in Device Manager and updated drivers for the Realtek Digital Output and Realtek High Definition Audio. Checked the cables, used my Xbox to confirm the HDMI cable, TV, and speakers were not the issue. All of this with several hard reboots in between steps.

When I right click and open Sounds settings it lists the output device as Realtek Digital Output and shows there should be sound being played as I have a Youtube video playing in the background to alert me if something fixes the issue. Device manager lists monitor as a generic pnp monitor.

No idea what to try next. Save me Reddit; you're my only hope.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I fixed it, partially... I noticed an error icon in Device Manager by the High Definition Audio Controller. I rolled back the driver to previous version and the sound suddenly started playing through the TV. My keyboard's audio control buttons still don't work on Spotify though, unless I have Spotify in focus. Used to be able to control Spotify with the prev/pause/next buttons no matter what window was currently in focus.

"Hello everyone, 

I've been looking around for a solution for this seemingly simple problem for quite a while now but just can't seem to find a solution for it. 

Here's my situation: My room is on the second floor of my family's home with our Internet Router in the basement. We life in Europe so our houses walls / floors are made out of straight concrete which makes it really hard for the wifi signal to reach basically anywhere. My room has a LAN connection to the Router so that's how my Desktop PC (that doesn't have Wifi)  is connected to the Internet. But obviously, I would still like to have a decent wifi signal for my phone, laptop, alexa, smart home devices, etc. 

So my question is: How can I use the one LAN exit in my room to provide me with a Wifi signal while still being able to connect my PC to it through LAN? 

I'm thinking there must be a single device with both a LAN input and output for this that also emits a wifi signal but I haven't been able to find something like that. I guess the alternative would be to split the lan cable into two and connect one to an access point while the other goes into my pc. But I read that with most Lan switches you can only use one of the connections at a time. 

Any help would be really appreciated. Either a link to a device similar to what I'm describing or a completely different method that I haven't thought of yet would be great.

"So, to back peddle a bit and give some context on when this started happening; I had followed a number of tutorials to overclock my PC (worked great, stopped using them after the first few runs of it) and went about looking for other tutorials to help the performance of my PC for not only gaming but in general. At first, everything was going smoothly until I decided to download something from a sketch site that wasn't the official source (not a pirating website actually) and ended up with a virus on my PC that prevented me from doing literally anything on it- so I was forced to wipe the PC from scratch.   


Jumped through a few hoops, got my PC to where I wanted it again, and did the tutorials /AGAIN/ but avoided downloading anything unnecessary - at FIRST, it worked out great, but cut to a few days later, my PC starts stuttering when running a game and even afterward, it still feels like there's a bit of lag to everything- a stutter here and there. Normally it's fine as long as I'm just on that ONE application, but if I have Chrome open and the game, swapping between them becomes a hassle of mixed stuttering and lag- nothing gruesome by any means, but it's starting to get on my nerves.   


The following links are the tutorials I followed;

At first I thought it was a simple dust build-up in the GPU fan so I cleaned it and it did not solve the issue. I proceeded to take every part out, clean the entire PC, re-applied the thermal paste on both my CPU and my GPU and this still did not solve the issue, I've tried stress tests (OCCT) and I left it running for 4 hours and it did not crash or say anything wrong with my PC, I also used Furmark and there still was no issue. I'll list the games I play detailing problems if they exist:

Phantasy Star Online 2 (During certain quests it MAY crash, not 100% of the time)

Fortnite (Crashes within an hour of playing)

Yuzu emulator Smash Brothers Ultimate (Crashes within 2-3 hours of playing)

League of Legends (Does not crash)

Brawlhalla (Does not crash)

GTA V (Does not crash)

Rocket League (Crashes within 20 minutes)

"First I am going tell you how I discovered this issue :My Keyboard (durgod k320 cherry mx blues) claims 1000hz polling rate but I tested on [http://blog.seethis.link/scan-rate-estimator/](http://blog.seethis.link/scan-rate-estimator/) and I got shortest key press 16 ms and estimated scan rate 62.5hz(USB 3.0). I know that this website is not accurate but I have some friends that have  50$ hyperx and corsair keyboards with 125Hz polling rate and they got 8-10 ms (they are not releasing the key faster than me. I tried this for 2 hours, believe me I mastered the technique ,16-17 is the lowest I got and my friends are not even trying that hard). Unlike other similar products there’s no way to check or set a polling rate in the durgod zeus engine. So why are they getting better results than me even though my polling rate is higher. 

results here [https://imgur.com/a/4OeldUl](https://imgur.com/a/4OeldUl)

I noticed that the ports that my devices are connected to don't have that 'S' that indicates superspeed (supported protocols 3.0) and instead they are connected to ""H"" ports that say supported protocols (1.1, 2.0) . Even then , my devices are connected to ""H"" ports (supported protocols 1.1,   2.0) but the speed is still Fullspeed(USB 1,1) shouldn't it say Highspeed (USB 2.0) [https://imgur.com/a/Dh9O6ml](https://imgur.com/a/Dh9O6ml)

"Hi! So first, thank you to anyone who takes the time to read and help, I really appreciate that this sub exists and the people who take the time to help others.

I just moved into a house apartment where the internet cost is included in rent. But what I wasn't told is that it's actually set up next door (the landlord owns both properties) and we share with them. We were having major problems with lag and dropping connection to the point it was unusable so the landlord was able to upgrade to 100mbps which improved quite a lot on my laptop.

But I'm still getting connection dropping, and any devices that are further from the Wifi next door just don't work (even across the room...). I have a Chromecast and haven't been able to use it as the connection drops out constantly and sometimes just won't connect.

I looked into repeaters or extenders but then I've read that slows down speed a lot and may not even work. Then I saw a suggestion to use a Wifi hotspot. So I set that up on my laptop. If I connect our other devices to that network, are there any likely issues? I tested it with my phone and it seems to be working well.

I don't want to do anything that creates major lag for the other tenants though, especially if there is a better solution. I also saw options for (I think) bridging and setting up our own router, but that seems beyond my ability...

Also wanna add.... my download speed is 5mbps and upload 1.7... this is pretty standard... the most I've ever got is 13/3... so yeah.. something is not right LOL",shared wifi connection thank take time read help really appreciate sub exists people time help moved house apartment internet cost included rent told actually set door landlord owns property share major problem lag dropping connection point unusable landlord able upgrade 100mbps improved quite lot laptop getting connection dropping device wifi door work chromecast able use connection drop constantly connect looked repeater extenders read slows speed lot work saw suggestion use wifi hotspot set laptop connect device network likely issue tested phone working want creates major lag tenant especially better solution saw option think bridging setting router wanna 've got 13,0

"Bought a cheap microphone that plugs into mic jack, and any program that accesses the microphone will freeze when it tries to use it. When I access Sound from Control Panel and choose the mic, that freezes too, and eventually comes back (and shows the volume bars) a few minutes later. I've noticed when this happens, I often lose audio altogether, as in my speakers stop working, and often my volume control freezes too, eventually coming back (along with the ping sound from volume adjustment) a few minutes later when it all unfreezes. My strategy during the pandemic has been to open zoom, let it freeze, kill zoom via task manager, reopen, let it freeze and a few minutes later it'll (usually) work.

"I actually have two problems and I'm not sure if they're linked or not.

Firstly, sometimes my PC doesn't boot and I get a one beep code (Dell support says: ""Possible motherboard failure - BIOS ROM checksum failure"").  However, whenever I turn it off and start it up again it always works.

&amp;#x200B;

The other problem is that sometimes my PC just totally freezes the screen whilst I've been using it and nothing works, no BSOD or anything.  I restart it and it's fine.  

I've looked at Event Logs and it doesn't show anything apart from the fact that the system was shutdown incorrectly (have to hold the power/reset button until it turns off). 

It seems to do it at random times under not much stress and it can go hours and hours or even days without doing it.

I recorded the times it's happened in the past week and couldn't notice any pattern or software that might be the cause:

\- Sunday 22nd @ 15:10

Screen froze whilst typing into a notepad document.   Lightroom open in background.  

\- Monday 23rd @ 17:05

Screen froze whilst loading a photo preview in Lightroom.    Word document and folder opened in the background.  

\- Sunday 29th @ 15:30

Screen froze with Firefox open, but I was away from my computer at the time.  Had some tabs open, but no videos or anything were playing, just things like FB, whatsapp, Reddit.    Had a folder open in the background.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've been using my computer pretty much constantly the past week and for way more intensive things a lot of the time, but it's only happened on these three occasions.

It's actually been happening for years, I've reinstalled Windows a number of times and it's also been happening both before and after I installed a new PSU &amp; SSD/HDD.

It's an old Dell XPS8100 running Windows 7 with 8GB RAM, i7 860 CPU, Corsair CX 500 PSU (upgraded from a Dell Liteon 350W Power Supply) with an SSD and HDD.

"So a couple days ago my computer just grey screened. I shut it off and tried to restart and that didn't work.

Now whenever I turn it on it takes me through the BIOS screen to a windows repair screen with a bunch of repair options and what not. None of those options work, at some point in the process they all restart the computer and when it restarts it goes through the BIOS screen and then just goes to a black screen.

The only thing I'm able to do is boot up in safe mode. I told a friend this and he said it sounded like a GPU driver issue. So I tried reinstalling the AMD drivers (I have a radeon 7870) but got an error. Apparently you can't install drivers in safe mode but that's the only way I can boot the computer up so I'm lost.

Other things I've tried are having windows look for any corrupted files and repairing them. It said it repaired some files but nothing changed. I also tried resetting windows from the earlier mentioned list of windows repair options but that didn't work either.

2. OS installed (my techy friend checked that the windows installed here was the oldest build which is 10240, and it will take a long time to be updated. NOTE: The repairman told me that if he continues the update it will hang more that is why he cancelled the windows autoupdate) 

3. Driver issues (this reason comes a lot in google)

One year ago I’ve decided to upgrade my monitor but I have done a big mistake. 
I’ve decided to buy a VN panel without doing the proper researches and now I’m not convinced at all and I’ve started thinking to replace it.

My current monitor is a MSI mag241c, 144hz 1ms. I’m currently using it only for gaming especially with fast pace games which require a lot of flicking.

I’ve read this kind of monitors are not the best for gaming because the pixel are slower to change colors and this cause a sort of “motion blur” effect in games with a lot of camera movements. 
This is what happened to me, I’m basically blind half of the times.

I want to know if someone was in my same situation and if a TN panel suits better for my usage or the differences are not so noticeable between the two technologies.",tn panel v vn panel hi guy year ago decided upgrade monitor big mistake decided buy vn panel proper research convinced started thinking replace current monitor msi mag241c 144hz 1ms currently using gaming especially fast pace game require lot flicking read kind monitor best gaming pixel slower change color cause sort motion blur effect game lot camera movement happened basically blind half time want know situation tn panel suit better usage difference noticeable technology,0

While stable it's staying at 43°C

I already know that this kind of temperature might be damaging for my CPU but I can't find a solution to this.

Insight:-  Yesterday while building my pc I had issues  with my CPU mounting. I had posted in reddit about it after finishing my built [I had posted in reddit about it after finishing my built ](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/k2vpil/first_time_building_a_pc_had_to_go_through_hell/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

In short what happened was the small springs in the stock cooler had to be pushed in with some amount of pressure to work. Because I was building on the motherboard box the motherboard was bending to much making it really hard to do so. So while aligning the screw of the cooler with the socket as my cooler was attached to the cpu with thermal paste it pulled the CPU out. Thus bending a pin. I fixed that pin back in and then screwed it on the bare floor. Where there was no static electricity. And then everything went just fine.

" Hello,  


So I recently bought a new PC, and from the very first windows installation I have experienced constant BSOD's. The first time I took the PC back and they had switched out the RAM, this however did not stop the BSOD's. Second time I took it back, they updated the realtek audio drivers, from what I could tell, and that seemed to stop the BSOD's for about a day. However since yesterday night the BSOD's are back. They seem to happen whenever e.g gaming, browsing internet or just PC being idle.  


BlueScreenView and Whocrashed both show different error codes and suspected drivers each time  


the system is win 10 64bit  
16gb ram  
b450 gigabyte gaming MB  
1660 gtx

Can anyone please help me identify what the issue could be before I return this back and try to get my money back for good.

"Hi everyone!

I own an AMD Radeon R9 270X Graphics card, and ever since I have it (it's probably like 8 years old now), there are texture and graphics flickering in all kinds of games, whether they are ""new"" (DOOM 2016, Wolfenstein II, Sekiro) or old (Halo Combat Evolved, for example).

All my graphics card drivers are up to date and I don't know anything about PCs so I really don't know where this flickering problem could come from, especially on the older games since my card should be able to run them perfectly.

I know it's a really vague problem, but does anyone have a clue of what I could do to solve this?

Hoping to get some help with solving this problem with my Sony Bravia from 2011.

Before I get into it, here's a photo of the screen for some context, as well as a shot of the T-Con board.

It seems as though the vertical lines have been appearing progressively over time, but recently they've gotten to this point. The problem isn't as prevalent in the first 10 seconds of starting up, but as it warms up the lines become even more blown out. The degree of the problem also depends on the image/colour.

"Hi, I recently added a monitor (ASUS VG249Q1R)  alongside my laptop (ACER VX 15 591G, HD 630 + GTX 1050) for extra multitasking real estate. My issue is when I try to run games via Steam/other gaming service it runs the game but doesn't load the graphics for it (there's a audio and a visible app window but it's mostly transparent/shows what's behind it on the desktop). 

I'm able to make things work by disabling HD 630 (Intel iGPU) temporarily and and running the game. Once the game is running, I reenable the HD 630 and the game will load normally with video, audio, and display the game on my second screen/monitor. I think the VX 15 has Optimus built in and it makes the choice for me. Is there any other workaround for this without flashing the BIOS to disable optimus?

This has been going on for a while. Generally, it has to connect to the wifi and then it works for a while, for streaming videos and such, but then when actively browsing, the connection gets lost.  
What we already tried was to update the drivers for the network controller, or roll back an update, reinstall the drivers. All of that.  
As it is currently, in order for it to work, I have to go to the Network controller properties, select ""update driver"" and then it works for a while.  
Under the events it lists:

Device not migrated

Device configured

Device installed

Device started

Also, there was the suspicion that it is due to the power saving settings in the device, however, there is no power management tab to be found here.

Would a complete system restore maybe solve the issue?  
Are there any other simple miracle cures that we might have overlooked?  
Many thanks in advance.",surface pro 6 keep losing internet connection going generally connect wifi work streaming video actively browsing connection get lost tried update driver network controller roll update reinstall driver currently order work network controller property select update driver work event list device migrated device configured device installed device started suspicion power saving setting device power management tab complete restore maybe solve simple miracle cure overlooked thanks advance,0
"Hi as the title suggests I am trying to undervolt my Inno3D 1080 Ti x3 ultra to reduce temps in a SFF build. I have had the card since 2017 and removed the stock cooler replacing it with an Arctic Extreme III driving a pair of case fans mounted next to the heat sink.

I have read about the power and cooling improvements available with an undervolt so used this guide to undervolt. https://sff.life/how-to-undervolt-gpu/

The documented card factory settings are high anyway with a base clock of 1607 and a boost of 1721.

Untouched (I have not overclocked it) the card was nevertheless boosting up to 1949, drawing 1.050 core voltage.

Following the guide I set figures down in steps to 1800 max and 0.875 core voltage.
However, after running timespy two dozen times HWiNFO64 and GPU-Z are still reporting the higher figures. I.e. the afterburner setting are not having any effect on the card performance. It is still drawing 1.050 and still boosting to 1949.

Motherboard is a Gigabyte Z370N wifi Mini ITX board. Not sure if there are setting on that which I need to adjust to make this work?

Grateful for any tips or pointers please. I don’t get it that Afterburner will have an effect if I set it to limit temperature but not for the undervolt settings.

‘Unlock voltage control’ is checked and set to reference design which this card is.
‘Enable low-level IO driver’ is checked.

"Okay, so system specs are as follows:
Intel Core i5 9600K

ASRock Z390 Phantom Gaming 4S

600 Watt Power Supply

16 GB DDR4-3000

GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER (msi Twin Frozr 7)

The problems started about a week in, newer games (I believe all of which are DirectX 12) began freezing and req. End Task seconds in to starting the actual game (menus worked fine). Let me specify, this was happening exactly the same for every game that is DirectX 12 only.

I rolled the drivers back and it seemed to work again for a day without that issue.

Then it started worse. I hadn't updated the driver, or anything else for that matter, and the crashes became more pronounced. Instead of a freeze it was a crash to desktop, some games (such as AC Valhalla) would start for a second or two with weird shader artifacts.

After rolling drivers around to try different versions, the problem persisted and I decided to format my new install in case something went awry with Windows.

Fresh install of Windows, Games, Direct X, Drivers etc. and that same exact problem persists.

I checked a hardware monitor back when the initial freezes started (checked again, even though no game could even approach putting a load on anything with how quickly they crash, if they even get to the point of drawing anything outside of a menu) and the temps all read fine except for a possibilty faulty sensor on the motherboard. (It reads over 100 celsius, idle, for CPU 4, but the temp sensor for the processor reads normal).

The only thing (I have tried many games) that uses DirectX 12 that works is 3D Mark stress test and benchmark. Other than that, no game will load and run past the menu and maybe a weird shader mess for a couple seconds.

I really don't want to go through the hassle of returning anything if I am missing something, but at this point I am running out of options for getting this build to work.

I have tried many different versions of the nVidia drivers, fresh install of everything including OS. 

Leaning towards this being something wrong with the video card just because everything else seems to be working fine and the fact that the current state of my PC is now exactly the same as it was when it was initially working, as if something is degrading due to load.

But if anyone has any suggestions or opinions I would love to hear them.

Thanks.

" I just bought sticks of truth in the steam sale, but when I tried to run it it gave me an error message, 'failed to load DX9 DLLS'.

Then you could download the newest variant of that file and the problem should be solved. It seems, however, that steam has changed the way it works in the context of this.

The main issue that is preventing me from using those guides:

\-starting the game from the folder instead of via steam doesn't show which DLL I am missing, now it just gives the generic 'DX9 DLLS' error.

"Back in April, I had my iPhone X repaired by Apple. They repaired the device at no charge because the screen was popping off of the bezel, so it was essentially a defect in the phone.  


Normally, I keep the phone in the bathroom when I'm showering, just in case I get something important. Well, after the shower, I noticed the screen wigging out, turning a green hue and then eventually it just went black. Now, the screen does not come on, but the phone is still responding when I hit the silencer rocker (it still vibrates if I get a call on Messenger, or turn it from silent to vibrate mode).  


So now, since it's a 3 year old phone, I decided it was time to upgrade. Unfortunately, my most recent backup is from April of this year, which is quite a while ago. Well, since the screen won't work, I can't unlock it and trust the computer to take the backup. Is there any possible way to recover the data off of this phone?  


Note: I tried repairing the screen, but it did not seem to work, the replacement screen was still black, so I believe there's something wrong with the connector on the logic board. I could be wrong though. As of now, however, I am unable to turn on the screen to unlock the phone. I've repaired dozen's of iPhone screens before in the past. From the looks of this one, it looks like Apple did not replace the waterproofing gasket and they scratched up some of the other internal components such as the bracket that holds down the display flex cables.",way data iphone x screen work april iphone x repaired apple repaired device charge screen popping bezel essentially defect phone normally phone bathroom showering case important shower noticed screen wigging turning green hue eventually went black screen come phone responding hit silencer rocker vibrates messenger turn silent vibrate mode 3 year old phone decided time upgrade unfortunately recent backup april year quite ago screen work unlock trust computer backup possible way recover data phone note tried repairing screen work replacement screen black believe wrong connector logic board wrong unable turn screen unlock phone repaired dozen's iphone screen past look look apple replace waterproofing gasket scratched internal component bracket hold display flex cable,0

"So initially I thought it was just a one time thing until it started happening almost once a day. I’ve done A LOT of things that i thought would help. I plugged the power into the wall directly instead of an outlet extender thing, updated all my drivers, underclocked my GPU and memory by a bit, etc. I’m just not sure what the problem is anymore. I recently went all out water cooling my PC and idk if i messed something up honestly. I REALLY dont think i did but i could be wrong. 

One thing to note is that my PC will crash MOSTLY on destiny 2? I have no idea why that game has made my PC just shut off and on but it has also happened once on Cold War and once on Valorant. I’m just really lost and would love some help before i panic and start buying new parts to check. Ill put my specs below and maybe someone has a solution.

MOBO: Z390 AORUS MASTER
CPU: I9-9900K usually running at 4.7GHz (water cooled)
GPU: 2080Ti running at 1875mhz (water cooled)
RAM: Corsair Vengeance DDR4 3600mhz (XMP ON)
PSU: EVGA 850w 80+ GOLD 

All the cooling are with EK components:
EK Velocity CPU Block
EK Vector Reference 2080ti block
EK Lian Li G1 Distro Plate with DDC 3.1 Pump

AND before anyone says anything about temps, Idle temps are 30-35. MAX I’ve seen it go to while under intense workloads or game sessions are 50-55. So i highly doubt its actually the temperatures doing this. My only guess would be is faulty PSU or i somehow fucked up my GPU when putting the waterblock on it but i dont see how that makes sense as I’m running other intense games perfectly fine but feels more like my CPU could be the reason. I wish there was a way to check why my PC shuts off randomly.

Now, I had no issues getting the build to Post, and went into BIOS, selected the SK Hynix SSD for my Windows 10 Pro install with no issues. Later, while installing some stuff I noticed the SK Hynix didn't even show up as a hard drive to install to. Upon further investigation I realized my PC didn't see the SK SSD at all. I went back into the BIOS and ran a Quick DTS self test on the SK SSD, which it failed. The Sabrent Rocket passed just fine. I figure my SSD is bad so I'll have to just swap windows over the the rocket while I get a refund on the SK Hynix. When trying to select the other SSD to install windows, I get a warning stating windows files have already been found and they will be set aside in a Windows.Old folder, and not be able to be used. ""uhhh.... Ok"", but the PC simply won't let me continue no matter how much I try to continue with the install. A friend tells me to take the faulty SK Hynix SSD out and re-upload my windows 10 fresh from my flash drive to the Rocket. Oki-dokie. Nope. Now BIOS won't recognize/can't see the Rocket SSD. I have NO choices to choose from to install the OS to. When I re-install the SK Hynix SSD, I can see it and the Rocket again. 

I am baffled. I have never run into this before. I'm currently using the 1TB SK Hynix SSD that my computer cannot even see to use, let alone install anything to, and I cannot seem to install windows to anything else to replace it.

"Around 6 years ago I was using a tiny little Acer notebook. Pretty low end, about $350. Within a year (as soon as the warranty ran out) it started having an issue with the hard disk and refused to boot up. Or rather, with multiple attempts, I could sometimes get it to boot up (I was luckily able to get all of my data off of this laptop before it became nearly impossible to boot.)

Since that laptop died, I've gone through a couple better laptops, and have been using a fairly powerful one for a couple years now. Its specs are as follows:

* 2.5 GHz quad-core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, Windows 10, dedicated graphics card

Despite a handful of slowdown issues (I'll touch on these in a moment) I would say it works decently well. However, while going through my old stuff, I decided to try booting up my old Acer netbook just to see if I could get it to boot at all. Not only did it boot up, but I was able to play around with it without an inkling of slowdown. Seeing it function so smoothly made me realize that the laptop I've been using doesn't perform anywhere near as well. And to clarify, these are the stats of said notebook:

* 1.5 GHz dual-core processor, 4GB RAM, Windows 7, integrated graphics card.

It doesn't make sense at all why this would perform so much better, but to be fair, it does appear that there are certain triggers for what my current laptop does poorly.

* dwm.exe - Interacting with the taskbar, opening up the start menu, interacting with Windows Explorer, or searching something in the start menu all have significant startup lag. Once these things are loaded into memory (not sure if it's loaded to RAM, cache, or both) they work just fine; in other words, once I've searched on term in the start menu, I can search others easily (until I stop using the search feature long enough for it to be purged from volatile memory.)
* Switching between processes -  Same issue as above. Reloading a page in Chrome after neglecting it for a while, or switching between Chrome, Unity, and Visual Studio, has a horrendous startup lag (to be fair, each of these processes is fairly heavyweight.) Windows Media Player seems to work just fine without this issue, likely due to its lower resource cost.
* Bottleneck upon startup or rousing from sleep - Again, this seems like a volatile memory issue to me. Once I interact with any of the processes that are jammed up, they eventually start to pick up and work just fine.

Investigating any of these slowdowns in Task Manager will yield a high System utilization of disk drives. I'm not exactly sure what's happening here, my guess is that at some point when RAM or cache memory are needed for the processes I'm using, volatile memory related to the processes I'm neglecting are being written to disk, and when I switch back to that process, they're being loaded from disk. Otherwise I have no idea why there would be such heavy load for something like this.

I also have a suspicion that Windows 10 (or perhaps something more low-level specific to my system) assumes users will not switch between processes (or use the taskbar) frequently and thus don't keep processes such as dwm.exe in active memory, whereas on my ""shitty"" netbook, the taskbar is always ready to go at a moment's notice. It almost feels like some kind of optimization to maximize the amount of RAM/cache available for a single process, only in my case it seems like all it does is slow things down.

Can anyone shed some light on what my laptop is doing and if there's a way I can check my RAM/cache for bad sectors, or change the way the memory is being used?",350 laptop run faster 800 laptop 6 year ago using tiny little acer notebook pretty low end 350 year soon warranty ran started hard disk refused boot multiple attempt boot luckily able data laptop nearly impossible boot laptop died gone couple better laptop using fairly powerful couple year spec follows 2 5 ghz quad core i5 processor 8gb ram window 10 dedicated graphic card despite handful slowdown issue touch moment say work decently going old stuff decided try booting old acer netbook boot boot able play inkling slowdown seeing function smoothly realize laptop using perform near clarify stats said notebook 1 5 ghz dual core processor 4gb ram window 7 integrated graphic card make sense perform better fair appear certain trigger current laptop poorly opening start menu interacting window explorer searching start menu significant startup lag thing loaded memory sure loaded ram cache work fine word searched term start menu search easily stop using search feature long purged volatile memory switching process reloading page chrome neglecting switching chrome unity visual studio horrendous startup lag fair process fairly heavyweight window medium player work fine likely lower resource cost bottleneck startup rousing sleep volatile memory interact process jammed eventually start pick work fine investigating slowdown task manager yield high utilization disk drive exactly sure happening guess point ram cache memory needed process using volatile memory related process neglecting written disk switch process loaded disk idea heavy load suspicion window 10 low level specific assumes user switch process use taskbar frequently process shitty netbook taskbar ready moment's notice feel kind optimization maximize ram cache available single process case slow thing shed light laptop way check ram cache bad sector change way memory used,0
"Hello!

I've scoured the interwebs and the picture is still not so clear.

Basically, I bought this internal SSD off a Black Friday whim for my rMBP that's ran out of usable space a long time ago. As you can see, it's a *Samsung 860 EVO 500 GB SATA 2.5 Inch Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) (MZ-76E500)*

[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-MZ-76E500B-EU-Solid-State/dp/B078WQT6S6](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-MZ-76E500B-EU-Solid-State/dp/B078WQT6S6)

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know that my current SSD (120GB) is a Samsung (I remember seeing it when I replaced the battery), so that's what APPLE SSD SM128E means (mentioned in the System Report).  
All the YouTube videos I see online upgrading this rMBP's SSD with a Samsung EVO SSD have the replacement SSD in a ""card"" format. There's talk of mSATA, M.2, and that people buy adaptors/connectors to fit those cards in; but there are no tutorials for this 2.5"" internal SSD form (even though there seems to be ample space inside the machine to fit one).  
Some tutorials (referring to the mid 2012 model) do manage it, and it seems to be a pretty straightforward swap; but apparently this rMBP is a mixed breed in terms of using some kind of Apple proprietary connector format? Something like that? Am I understanding things right?

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the specs for my machine from Apple:, the *MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2012)* (aka MacBook Pro 10,2):

# Attempted Solutions:

1. Unpaired and re-paired the device
2. Updated all drivers (All up-to-date)
3. Disconnected all other bluetooth devices
4. Ran audio troubleshooter (No issue detected)
5. Ran bluetooth troubleshooter (No issue detected)
6. Disabled Audio Enhancements (Tab does not appear in device properties)
7. Changed Audio Format (Options are greyed out)
8. Updated Windows
9. Disabled Hands-free Telephony
10. Disabled all bluetooth features except Audio Sink
11. Update drivers &gt; Search my computer &gt; Select from a list &gt; uncheck ""Show compatible hardware"" &gt; Microsoft + Handsfree Audio Gateway Service
12. Same as number 4, but with Headset Audio Gateway Service
13. Disabled Microsoft Bluetooth LE Enumerator in Device Manager

# Things to note:

* The device works fine with my iPhone.
* Trying a second bluetooth audio device has the same issue.
* I read that 2.4GHz wifi might be an issue.

Hi, I told my friend to get Clownfish Voice Changer and after he uninstalled it (didn't like it) it pretty much broke his input and output on his computer.

The Realtek device wouldn't appear in the device manager, so he installed new Realtek drivers. Then, everything worked except the Realtek Audio Console program which he wanted, so we tried a LOT more stuff (which I can try to explain if necessary but it mostly consisted of installing older Realtek drivers, doing a windows update, uninstalling Realtek drivers, and restarting). Sometimes this would fix issues, but there was always at least one problem with the input, output, or program.

Currently, he has the drivers uninstalled and his speakers work, but the mic on his headset doesn't.

Does anyone know what Clownfish might have done to the drivers or how to reinstall them correctly? I think we may have done it wrong, all we did was download the drivers from the website here: [https://realtek-download.com/download-hd/](https://realtek-download.com/download-hd/)

I'm sorry that this is so vague, but I can't contact him to get really specific details right now.

"Hi all, firstly please excuse my lack of tech knowledge!

I just upgraded my brand new laptop (MSI GF75 10SDR) with extra RAM and added 1TB SSD in the empty SATA slot. The stock storage is 512GB SSD (M.2 slot).

Prior to the upgrade, I had read a lot of stuff about setting the boot options in the BIOS, partitions and putting/cloning the OS onto the SSD for much faster boot time and loading programs/games, versus on the internal HDD. (I'm still trying to understand all that)  
I actually didn't realise the stock storage is already an SSD and not a HDD, and realised that the stuff I read didn't really apply to me. 

My questions are:

*  Is there a need to move the OS onto the new 1TB SSD?

"Hi!

I'm trying to port forward to open up my Minecraft server, but even after port forwarding, canyouseeme.org says that it cannot see port 25564 because the connection timed out. I don't have much knowledge of this topic, so I was hoping Reddit could help me :D

I'm using Google WiFi, and supposedly have another router. Some sites have been telling me to set my router in bridge mode; Google WiFi says it's already in Bridge mode.

When port forwarding, I'm using 25565 as both my external and internal port. Is that correct?

"I've been having this problem for a while now. Whenever there is a power fluctuation, the PC will shut down and then turn on despite it being connected to the UPS. But the UPS supplies power for everything else like the monitor so the problem isn't with the UPS since I just got a new one a month ago.

Now with this, the only plausible solution based on what I've researched and discovered is that the PSU has to be replaced. But my dad doesn't agree with that notion and to be certain that the issue is with the PSU, he called a technician to check in, he said that the issue could be related to ram and not on the PSU. But then the other problems I have with the PC is that now the power button occasionally works and when it doesn't power on the PC, I have to keep pressing it until it does. So I don't know what causes the PC to shut down whenever there is power fluctuation and I'm not able to focus on my work and such. Is there a way to determine whether the issue is with the PSU or with the Ram?

"Hiya,

&amp;#x200B;

I do have CentOS 7.5 Minimal that I have valuable information and data on and I need to have a backup. But I'm having many difficulties and strange things happened when I tried to create the backup. I'll try to keep issues in a small manageable size, thus I'm asking a part of questions in a time:

This is how my Root drive looks like and I believe I only have about 2'586.7M of data and the size of the SSD in my VPS is about 10.7GB I believe as below:

[https://prnt.sc/vs47zs](https://prnt.sc/vs47zs)

&amp;#x200B;

I ran a backup command to backup and compress everything in a 'Tar.gz' file as

    &gt;tar -zcvpf /backup/full-backup-`date '+%d-%B-%Y'`.tar.gz --directory / --exclude=mnt --exclude=proc --exclude=tmp --exclude=backup

But output was a 5.76GB file in '.Tar.gz' format that doesn't make sense at all. And the file was stopped creation as well, on the command line in the Console, I encountered this screen after about a month time that I let this file be created,

 [https://prnt.sc/vs4amc](https://prnt.sc/vs4amc)

Then I Ctrl+Alt+Del the VPS from Console and it changed to this for a second before it restarts,

[https://prnt.sc/vs4b1j](https://prnt.sc/vs4b1j)

&amp;#x200B;

Output was the 5.76GB file in full-backup-tar.gz without any date in the file name as it encountered short space in the drive. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is how my drives in VPS looks like as well:

[https://prnt.sc/vs4c23](https://prnt.sc/vs4c23)

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything wrong with my backup command that this happened and how shall I fix this backup issue?

I want an intact ***bare-metal backup in a compressed format*** that in case I moved my VPS provider, I can change the IP and then my VPS backup shall work in all the bare-metal KVM VPS providers. May please help me achieve this and please do ask about screenshots if required to give technical data for the answer and I'll happily reply.

"Okay this is a lot of information so be ready and please read everything that I have done

In 2019, I bought a second hand Gigabyte RX 580 4GB graphics card in 2019, with a 500 watt 80 plus bronze power supply, i5-4460, 12gb ddr3, stock dell case and mobo

Forever then, my pc would have no problems, would run kinda hot because i shoved a big ass gpu in a small office pc but it's whatever

in 2020 I got my first 144hz monitor, and I've been using it ever since, and I have slowly been having more and more problems using my computer in graphic intensive games and software

THIS ISSUE IS RESOLVED BUT IM TELLING IT JUST IN CASE

my graphics card would shut itself off and turn back on whenever i reached the 80 degree celsius mark for more than 30 minutes at a time, running full blast fans and getting super hot

i resolved this by undervolting and underclocking my graphics card, and since my old case was shitty, i have since then updated to a ryzen 3 3100, a320m motherboard, and a good case with tons of airflow

since early 2020, I have been having this problem that is somewhat similar to the crashing ingame

while rendering any super intensive part of a video i am editing in after effects, my monitor will freeze, sound will turn off, monitor turns off, then turns back on after about 7 seconds and sound comes back

sometimes my monitor and sound never turn back on and instead my whole entire pc restarts

i am then told in my AMD Radeon Settings that the default Wattman settings were restored due to an unexpected software crash

&amp;#x200B;

SINCE ALL OF THIS I HAVE TRIED:

* reinstalling after effects (still crashes on non-pirated after effects too so its not because of pirated software)
* resetting my pc (works, but came back after a week or so)
* reinstalling/uninstalling intensive effects on videos
* undervolted, underclocked gpu
* overvolted, overclocked gpu
* display driver uninstaller, reinstalled drivers
* manually reinstalled drivers
* rollback drivers
* adjusted TONS of different settings in radeon settings

&amp;#x200B;

so what i am asking for is this:

* is there anything I can do to use after effects without having my graphics card crash?
* should i switch to nvidia?
* is my graphics card the problem because it is second hand?\\

today i will try the following:

* try to edit with connecting my monitor to the motherboard instead of the gpu, so i dont have to use my gpu while editing
* try editing on 60hz display settings instead of 144hz

"So I’ve been looking to get rid of some old devices but I’ve been uneasy about some things I’ve learned about hard drives.

On the one hand I heard you can have your hard drive wiped on pretty much any device, BUT I also heard that this doesn’t permanently delete the data and there is still a way to retrieve data from a wiped hard drive. (Even if you take it to a professional. Which btw what places even do that??)

If that’s true than that means the only way to truly get rid of everything on a hard drive is to destroy it. BUT
-what about iPads? (iPad 1/2, iPad Air 2, iPad 5th generation) they say you cannot remove or replace a hard drive. (Also bonus is there a way to even see what’s on the hard drive despite not being able to take it out?) also what happens when you recycle it? Do you request to be given the hard drive?
-what if you have a really old laptop (2010/2012) acer. How much do you think it would be to replace? WHERE could you even go to pay someone to do so?
- Mac book pro. All I see is how apple wont work on older devices.

Sorry if it seems like I’m paranoid but I thought I had everything figured “I’ll just go and pay like 50-100 bucks per device to have them wiped and then it’s unretrievable and gone” but as I’m doing more research I hear “even if a hardware is wiped the data can still be retrieved/ doesn’t go away unless you destroy it”

"Hi everyone, sorry if this isn't the place for this type of question.

I'm moving into a RV full time, and I'm taking my gaming PC with me. I've got a 2080 TI graphics card which is pretty big. I just realized that whenever we move, it's going to be bouncing around quite a bit on the road.

My concern is that this may stress the port it's connected to on the motherboard. Is this a valid concern? I thought I could probably just ball up a t-shirt or something and put it underneath the card whenever we're moving to give it some support.

I just don't want it to bounce up and down and like snap off the connectors or break the port on the motherboard. I have no idea how sturdy they are or if I'm at risk for damaging anything. The only other option I see is removing it every time we move, but that seems like it may be worse for the port over time.

"Hey guys, you are my last hope

Recently I updated my GPU and since then I started to notice some very weird flickering/lag/stutter which happens in multiple situations but it's most notable when scrolling through apps. Please check the link below to understand what I mean:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTpP6OlGD3A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab\_channel=Cassar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTpP6OlGD3A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=Cassar)

The issue also happens in other web browsers such as Chrome and even Edge. The issue is more notable when there are images/GIFs moving around while I'm scrolling. I was able to record the issue using Action, I'm assuming that if I was able to record it then it means it can't be a problem with the monitors or with the cables, right?

Now I am going to list the things I have tried in order to help you narrow down what the problem could be.

I have already tried reversing back to my old GPU (I didn't change any drivers, I only changed the card itself) and the issue persisted, which makes me think that the fact that this started after I upgraded my GPU might be a coincidence. The other hardware related fixes that I have attempted were: I have tried turning the computer on with only one monitor (I have a triple monitor setting usually) and I have tried multiple cables (4 different displayport 1.2) and an HDMI cable. I'm not sure if my displayport cables have shielding against interference, so that could be the issue I suppose.

Now to the things that I have tried when it comes to software: I have tried turning freesync on, turned on hardware acceleration for windows, turning on/off smooth scrolling. I have tried changing the frequency of the monitors (59.940Hz, 59.997Hz, 60.000Hz, 64.006Hz). I have even gone as far as reverting to an old version of Windows because I thought the issue could be related to the recent updates. Nothing.

The interesting thing in all of this is that it only seems to happen in certain scenarios. My monitors are 4k60Hz, and I often open an youtube video on that quality just to test and I see that the video is silky smooth, this problem does not happen at all. This issue also does not happen while I'm gaming, even at 4k with every setting on Ultra. I get no frame drops and no weird flickering. It does happen with some games but I can chalk that off as being the game's fault.

I'm completely lost as to what this could be and I really hope you guys can help me out. Thank you so much in advance for taking your time to read this.

"In these weeks i'm searching about this topic, because i use a PS3 controller in pc since 6 years, (and 10 in his normal use, in a PS3 Console), so the battery is getting old and when I pressed two buttons in the same time, another button is pressed. 
For example I press D-Pad right and X button and the Triangle button is pressed because yes. So this is funny to see in games like GTA V, trying again the mission in online because that. Fortunately I have another PS3 controller more new that the came with the console 10 years ago. But I thinking in changed it and let it sleep eternally.

So my choices are the Xbox Series Controller, specially the Blue color because I looks sexy, the PS5 Dualsense Controller and the Switch Pro Controller.

Why this controllers? Well:

The Xbox Series Controller because:
• is Windows Friendly, that means i don't bother for the drivers don't work, or i don't have vibration because the drivers, or my controller freaks out while i charging, etc. Is for Windows 10
• I heard the shape improves since the Xbox One Controller, the grip and feel is good with the new texture, and back to 2009 when i feel the Xbox 360 controller, I wanted a Xbox controller because is more comfortable than the PlayStation controller.
• For me looks so beautiful, comparing it with the others i've mentioned in here
• Is not problem for me, but looking the right buttons in the games according the controller, see Y in the game and controller. Not Triangle only in the controller.
• The d-pad looks great i think for tetris and old games/plataformers i want to play.

The PS5 Dualsense because:
• Too much content creators says this controller is so comfortable and so grippy
• The adaptive triggers buys me, looks so attractive and it is implemented so great in shooters (i don't play shooters with controller but only for this technology wants me to play it that way), but I don't know if sony or a third-party driver enable this for PC and the developers want to implement this on the newer and existing PC Games, And I'm doubting because i see on several pages the PS4 Controller the touchpad and the speaker is not fully enhanced or supported in PC drivers, so that's the thing
• The black color looks so beautiful for me, i want it only in that color i don't like in white. Or something in blue, so i must to wait for that editions.
•The same for the rumble applies to the adaptive triggers, only hopes sony or a person and the developers adapt this to PC

The Switch Pro Controller:
• I have a Switch, so i use it in that and PC. Because the Joycons are not the best
• The buttons of the control looks so clicky and confortable and the Joystick is not getting drift like the joycons.
• My friends says the battery longs too much with life, more than the new generation of consoles i think
• The dpad its not great but is ok 
• The rumble i heard is great.

So this is my opinions about the controllers, i want a confortable control and i play adventure games, racing games, and sometimes tetris marathon. If i choose another controller and i want to use it on switch, can i buy the 8bitdo adapter, so i can't get stucked for the pro controller to my decision. What do you think? Which controller I listed here is the best for PC?

"Hey guys,

After a bit of help here if anyone can help!

A few weeks ago, I moved my PC from one room to another. Previously it was connected via ethernet and moved it into a room that didn't have an ethernet port set up.
Everything worked fine on WiFi until I set the ethernet port up and plugged the cable in.
I booted it up and it showed the BSoD with the error ""Stop Code: VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE ~ What failed: amdkmdag.sys""

After a bit of research it looked like there was a graphics driver update issue. The computer would still turn on every now and then, so I uninstalled drivers and reinstalled + updated to the latest using the manufacturers website. (AMD Radeon Software Adrenaline) 

Since then, the computer hasn't been able to boot up at all. It shows the error 
""stop code: 0xc00021a""
I can't boot the computer up into safe mode, it won't let me reset it, I've tried reseting bios and running the diagnostics tool but they all fail. The only thing I can get into is the command prompt.


I tried following the steps in this post here : https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3ttjp3/_/
But had no luck in completing the steps

Am I out of luck? It's a very old build but it ran the games I played and was a great work PC.

"Hey guys, I’m new to pc’s I bought mine off offerup and upgraded the gpu amongst other things. Anyway, one day I was just on my pc and one of my games wouldn’t launch, so I was just gonna restart my pic and hoped that would fix it but it took way too long to actually turn off it was just stuck on restarting screen. So I just held down the power button till it turned off (stupid I know) and then tried to power it back on but it was just stuck on the GIGABYTE screen. I left it off for like a week because that’s how I solve problems hoping they resolve themselves and after a few attempts it did eventually turn back on and that’s when I noticed that in the file explorer my second storage device wasn’t showing up. I tried looking through like Disk Manager and devmgmt and it showed up there but not in the file explorer. Maybe that was why my game wasn’t launching. Then after watching YouTube videos and trying different things it showed up in the file explorer and I was like “oh okay sick” and I clicked on it and it did the “not responding” thing so I tried to just close it and then everything but the file explorer window went black so i again just shut it off with the power button and now it’s on the gigabyte screen saying it’s repairing the (D:) drive as of 5pm yesterday, it is currently 2 pm today and it’s at 15% and has been on this entire time I’m just concerned. I suppose my questions are
What happened initially, or what did I do to cause the initial problem and did it end up causing this one? Or are they the same problem? Like somehow the second storage just idk stopped working? Or maybe disconnected? Do I have to open up the pic and check something? Again, I didn’t build it or upgrade the parts myself.

"Hi, so I had left my Xbox One S unused for a few months (before this it was working).  
And just recently I decided I wanted to use it; however, when I plug in the power cord and turn it on absolutely nothing happens. I've tried different ac ports and different cables and had no success. I've also tried to turn it on with the controller and also nothing. Not sure if it means anything, but when I hook up the controller to the USB port I get a rumble (but it still doesn't turn on).  
This eventually led me to follow this video:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GagzJMcGcfc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GagzJMcGcfc)  


So I got out my multi meter and tested the power supply to see if it was broken/faulty. Upon testing this, the readings turned out to be correct across all pins (12v).  So I got down to the motherboard; to test for continuity, by checking the pins of the where the power supply socket goes in. Testing from top to bottom for each pin I get no beep. Testing it from the bottom;  from left to right, I get a beep. All this points towards the motherboard having no issues. So I went to test the mosfets by putting one multi meter pin to the Xbox One S gold pads to ground it, and another pin to the one of the mosfet pins, which returns no beep for all mosfets tested (mosfets don't appear to be the issue). The only thing I haven't tested is the RF board as I don't have a spare. I'm not sure how to test if it works without ordering a spare one.

"So I built my computer a while back, and being the first computer I ever built, I was dumb and installed Windows to my HDD instead of my SSD. Recently my computer has gotten cluttered and what not so I just wanted a fresh start, so I migrate all of my important files to my HDD, then format my SSD so I can install windows properly this time. I find my windows product key and write that down, download the media creation tool to a usb so I can install windows, and I thought I’m off to the races right? Wrong! I unplug all drives so all I have is the SSD, and the USB. Media creation boots, and I’m met with three problems. 1. I type in my product key and it isn’t valid, leading me to believe I must have jotted the key down wrong. I thought no big deal, I haven’t formatted my HHD so I can still get the key. I’ll just install windows without it and add the key later. 2. The SSD has a notification that windows cannot be installed onto it, and I don’t understand why. The drive is formatted correctly, plus I formatted the drive a second time inside the media creation tool, and it says it isn’t able to install. Again, I thought no big deal, I’ll boot up my old drive and just look things up and figure it out. 3. I cannot get my system to boot. My BIOS recognizes my HDD, it’s selected as boot priority, and it won’t boot. Always takes me straight to bios without even attempting to boot. This brings me to an interesting topic I don’t understand - I know for sure that windows was installed on the HDD, not the SSD, and when I formatted the SSD obviously windows didn’t break cause there weren’t any important files on there. Honestly all I migrated from that drive was some steam games and adobe software. However, prior to doing all this, my computer only booted when I selected the SSD as the boot priority despite it not having windows installed on it. If I unplugged my HDD with windows on it, the SSD was not enough to boot alone, and if the SSD wasn’t in the HDD wasn’t enough to boot alone. I figured this wouldn’t be an issue cause I thought I’d be able to just install windows on the SSD and forget about that ever being a problem, but here it is haunting me. Does anyone know what I can do? Please ask for any details that could help you help me, I’m not tech illiterate, but I am tech inexperienced I guess.

Recap: I have a formatted SSD that won’t let me install windows, I have an HDD with windows installed that won’t boot, and my windows product key isn’t working (likely because I simply wrote down one of the 25 freaking characters wrong), and I have no way (to my knowledge) of retrieving the product key without booting my HDD.

Side note: I do have other computers in the house that I can use to plug the HDD or SSD into if need be.

since yesterday I have the problem that my hdd hard drive no longer works. The PC switches itself off and on restarting the PC hangs in the boot menu for up to 7 minutes, then starts, but the hard disk is not recognized. In addition, there were 2 sounds from the hard drive.

**2020-11 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 2004 for x64-based Systems (KB4586781)**

I've seen a few people saying that this update has had issues with installing, but I haven't seen anything past that. As soon as the update finishes downloading and reaches 100%, it says,

""Error encountered

some update files are missing or have problems. We'll try to download the update again later. Error code: (0x80070000d)""

&amp;#x200B;

and it gives me the option to retry the update, but every time I do, I get the same error message.

I have tried to manually download the update, but every time the installer finishes, I get the text,

&amp;#x200B;

""The following updates were not installed:

Security Update for Windows (KB4586781)""

&amp;#x200B;

Some people have told me to reinstall windows, which I have, and every time, on every fresh install, the same update fails every single time, no matter what I do it feels like.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of all of this, when I try and run the windows update troubleshooter I get an error that says that something prevented it from running, so I can't even use the built-in troubleshooter.

&amp;#x200B;

Something else that I have tried is several command prompt ""fixes"" according to some websites. After running the command 

**sfc /scannow**  several times, every time I get the same answer

"Got a weird one for y'all, maybe.

My desktop PC (homebuilt) will occasionally, when clicking a link or opening a new tab in Firefox, do a hard reboot with an audible clicking sound. Total power off, then it'll bounce right back and power on after a few seconds.

At first I thought it was a CPU overheating issue, but temps aren't out of line and replacing the thermal paste didn't fix it.

I'm thinking it has something to do with the GPU, actually. Disabling hardware acceleration in the Firefox options seems to prevent this from happening, but it can go weeks at a time without the issue so this is another one of those hard to debug ones. This hasn't happened while gaming at all, I can run a benchmark without issue. The problem has only happened when using the browser that I've seen.

Any tips for things I can try to debug or prevent this? I'm running a 1080Ti, hoping to upgrade to a 3080 (whenever I end up actually getting my hands on it) with maybe a new mobo, and really praying that fixes it.

"Disclaimer: I’m not sure if it’s actually the RTX 3080 that causes the problems, I’ve heard about tremendous problems with it, though and I was one of the first ones to get the graphic card. 


I’ve had this pc build for 1 month so far and have been dealing with following issues:

This happens mostly during Zoom meetings for some reason: My monitor just goes black and goes into power saving mode and I can see that my pc crashed as the RGB colors go instantly to default mode. In that scenario, I always have to restart my pc again.

2nd scenario: This happens mostly when I am not touching or moving the mouse cursor and just watch a stream etc. My screen just freezes and I cannot do again and just a moment after, I see that my pc RGB went into default mode again meaning it crashed. In that scenario, I also have to restart. 

For some reason, it never crashes during games but during these random moments when I don’t necessarily do much or just am on Zoom. 

My drivers are up to date so that’s out of the question.

Any ideas ?

Upon opening RGB Fusion 2.0, I can see the motherboard and the RAM as modifiable options. They seem to work fine, however there are more lighting zones on the motherboard in the software than seem to change in the case, though they could be covered up by the monster graphics card so I'm not sure if those are not working or if they are just covered. My main concern though is my Enermax CPU Cooler is not recognized by RGB Fusion even though it says it is rated for it on the website. I can't seem to find any info on this by searching, only that RGB Fusion is horrid. I'm afraid to update BIOS as I've heard it can brick the RGB functions or even the motherboard entirely.

Everything is currently running at stock speed/power, haven't overclocked anything.

Of course, first go to is there's something wrong with the GPU/thermals/etc. Could be, but I haven't been able to recreate the issue running GPU stress/stability tests. They all work fine with everything in normal temperature range. Also while in game, everything looks to be in normal range when it crashes, and looking at the .txt file of my GPU data, I don't see any abnormal spikes/drops leading up to the crash.

Rundown of everything I've done so far, in order, that hasn't worked.

1. Ran DDU uninstaller and removed the most recent driver (470.30 I  think), then reinstalled it.
2. Ran DDU uninstaller and removed the fresh install and installed the driver version before that.
3. Then ran DDU again and reinstalled the most recent driver as that didn't seem to be the issue.
4. Removed the GPU, took the back plate off to look for any obvious signs of damage/whatever
5. Ran the Heaven Benchmark 4.0, everything worked fine
6. Ran the Freestone Group GPU stability test, everything worked fine.
7. Ran the 3dmark timespy benchmark, no issue

Anyone have any other ideas as to what the issue could be? Unfortunately I don't have access to another PC/parts readily available, so I can't start swapping pieces out to verify if it is in fact the GPU causing the issue or not.

I feel like I tried everything but no luck. Lights go on and I can hear the AIO but no POST (with speaker module connected to pins) and no image to monitor.

\- Used Q Flash utility to update to latest (f31j) BIOS. Renamed to GIGABYTE.bin as site described and appeared to work correctly. (light when on and flashed for a couple minutes then turned off)

\- Reseated CPU, GPU, RAM and all cables multiple times

"Hello everyone,

I just upgraded an HP EliteBook 840 G2 to a 500 GB SSD.  This necessitated the reinstall of Windows 10 Professional. I also enabled ""Lid Open Action"" options in the ""Advanced Settings"" using powercg in an administrator command prompt. 

powercfg -attributes SUB_BUTTONS 99ff10e7-23b1-4c07-a9d1-5c3206d741b4 -ATTRIB_HIDE

I then selected ""Turn on the display"" for both Battery and Plugged in. I then rebooted the laptop. Despite this, Windows ignores these settings and does not turn the display on when I open the lid. When I open the lid, the power button slowly illuminates and dims. Once I press it, the display will come on.

"I have a Lenovo laptop for work and a MacBook for home. Now that I am working from home, I am planning to buy a USB-C monitor for more screen real estate.

I would like to have a work station with a USB-C monitor + wireless keyboard + wireless mouse. I would like to take one USB-C cable and plug it into my Lenovo during the day so that I can use the screen, keyboard, and mouse. Then in the evening simply take that cord and plug it into the MacBook so I can use the screen, keyboard, and mouse. 

What's the best way to set this up? I assume the keyboard and mouse cannot be bluetooth (because then I'd have to connect the devices to each laptop each time I want to use them), but would instead have to use wireless receivers to connect the devices to some sort of hub. Any tips?

THANKS!

"Hello! I just finished building my wife her first PC!  But we are experiencing some issues with the ethernet internet speeds. Let me explain the setup:

We use Verizon Fios 200 Mbps internet. Due to our residence, the Fios only has one connection, on the ground level.  Our office is upstairs on the second floor.  To use the internet up there I have been using the Netgear Powerline - Ethernet over power extender. This device has two plug in parts. The first goes down by the router, with one ethernet cable plugged into it and itself plugged into the outlet. This device pairs with the second plugin upstairs, which then runs an ethernet cable out. This used to go straight to my PC and I have had no issues with speed. Now however, I have plugged this into a Netgear ethernet switch, subsequently taking two other ethernet cable and plugging one into my PC and one to hers. 

At this point we noticed her speeds dropping drastically. An LED indicator on the Netgear plug, the ""Pick A Plug LED"", shines amber. This indicates speed going between 50-80Mbps. When I shut my PC down, the light turns green, indicating speeds greater than 80Mbps. 

I hope I provided enough info.  At this point, I'm not sure how to remedy this issue without new hardware. I suspect I will be buying a second set of ethernet over power plugs just for her PC, or getting a ridiculously long ethernet cable to run upstairs. This home is a rental so there is no wiring the place up like I would do as a homeowner. 

Is there anyway to work around this issue with the current hardware we have? Would I run into issues using two sets of ethernet over power plugs? Let me know if you need more information, and thank you in advance.",internet speed ethernet power issue hello finished building wife experiencing issue ethernet internet speed let explain setup use verizon fios 200 mbps internet residence fios connection ground level office upstairs second floor use internet using netgear powerline ethernet power extender device plug part go router ethernet cable plugged plugged outlet device pair second plugin upstairs run ethernet cable used straight issue speed plugged netgear ethernet switch subsequently taking ethernet cable plugging point noticed speed dropping drastically led indicator netgear plug pick plug led shine amber indicates speed going 50 80mbps shut light turn green indicating speed greater 80mbps hope provided info point sure remedy new hardware suspect buying second set ethernet power plug getting ridiculously long ethernet cable run upstairs home rental wiring place homeowner work current hardware run issue using set ethernet power plug let know need information thank advance,0

"I recently got an M.2 the other day and I've noticed most games not performing right. After some testing and research, I've found that my PCI slot for my GPU is running in x8 instead of x16. I've done benchmarks with the m.2 in and out and notice a big frame rate loss in some games and stutters when I go from x8 and x16.

losing 900 points in Time Spy GPU and in Forza 4 losing around10% FPS and stutters, while some other games don't care like Tarkov.

Most people online seem to think this won't make a difference but it really is for me and I don't know how to fix it. Even GN did a video and showed only a tiny performance hit but this is not the case for me.

I tried putting the M.2 in the top slot on the mobo but it disabled 2 of the SATA ports. Also, note the games aren't even running off the m.2.

How can I get my GPU to run in x16 with this m.2? OR maybe there is something the bios making the GPU run like shit at x8?

"Running windows 10 on a laptop, have been unable to troubleshoot this issue via google searches

&amp;#x200B;

I am attempting to connect this USB to HDMI adaptor to one of my monitors, [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TT6WZ7V/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_image\_o03\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TT6WZ7V/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

&amp;#x200B;

I can confirm that the monitor in question is plugged in correctly and working, because when I plug it directly into the HDMI slot on my laptop it connects fine, however when plugged into the USB adaptor the monitor in question will not recognize the signal.

I have also confirmed that I am plugging the adaptor into the USB 3.0 slot (with the blue coloring on the slot)

It did not automatically install the driver as far as I could tell

The adaptor came with a small CD, which I assume was for the driver software - however I do not have a CD slot on this computer to put it in, so when I plugged in the adaptor it asked me something like 'what do you want the computer to do when you plug this in' so I selected run as a CD, which brought up a list of 2 drivers for install, one for windows 7-10 and one for windows XP. I installed the Windows 7-10 driver, which I can confirm is in the devices list under XXX display.

&amp;#x200B;

However, after doing and restarting the computer, as well as uninstalling, reinstalling and restarting again, it still does not recognize the signal.

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering if - because I told it to run as a CD (every time I plug it in, it brings up the driver list for install again) that it is not loading it correctly and perhaps I need to change the setting that causes it to run as a CD? If that's the case, I do not know how to do that.

To get it working again, I have to spend over an hour restarting, uninstalling, and disabling the adapter and laptop randomly in hopes that it will somehow reconnect. I haven't noticed a pattern that will always work, it will just decide to connect again whenever it feels like it, I guess. I've tried everything that comes up online - disabling and reenabling, not allowing it to turn off to save power, troubleshooting, and nothing ever sticks. In a few days, it'll happen again. 

The code I usually get when it's in hidden devices in device manager is 'Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer. (Code 45)'. So I assume the physical adapter is loose or something? But I try my hardest to not move my laptop and it still disconnects. It will work at 11 pm one night, I sleep it, don't touch it, and the next morning, it's disconnected. And I don't do anything physically with my laptop that causes it to eventually reconnect. I want to avoid having to open up my laptop if possible so I want to see if anyone here knows what is going on.

"Joined reddit just for this.

So of course every web search result is about mysteriously losing space, or deleting files not affecting leftover free space. I have the opposite issue.

I recently did the Windows refresh -with keeping media files- thing, then redownloaded my Ninite stuff and games. I got a priced to move 2070 Super (so someone out there got their 3070), and wanted to be sure bloatware leftovers etc. wouldn't be slowing things down. Boot/logging in was creeping back to 7200rpm levels at least in my head. And the Windows ""reinstall"" did the trick. I also confirmed nothing from My Music/Pictures/Movies/Docs was deleted.

**FOR THE RECORD: I DID DELETE ""WINDOWS.OLD"", RAN DISK CLEANUP AS ADMIN, ALL THE BASICS TO FREE UP SPACE ON THE C: DRIVE.**

My SSD is only 512, so I was pushing it to its limit just initially to test out some old games to see how they'd run now. Hitman 1 being the biggest. Oh, and I got cheap Game Pass. So I had taken the SSD down to just 25GB free of the 476 possible.

A week or so later, after trying out a bunch of software to see what I liked best (example: irfan, xnview, faststone, digikam, and restoring Windows Live Photo Viewer with a registry edit) I decided to do a system restore to the day before, figuring more so than Revo or whatever it'd be the best way to make sure there's no leftover registry entries bogging things down.

The system restore failed, however, and I didn't think to write down the error message. But I didn't think anything of it, uninstalled stuff manually, and everything seemed fine until the next day I notice:

Free space on C: is now 75GB! That is a huge difference! Nothing seems to be deleted from the My Name folders, and all my games seem to be installed still, especially the biggest ones who could make a 50GB difference were they deleted -Forza Horizon 4 and Hitman-.

If this is an error in Windows reading how much space is truly left, I worry that it'll start overwriting my stuff on space it thinks is free.

I'm installing WinDirStat as I type this to see if it matches This PC:

"TL;DR Have system stutter in Windows, can't fresh install Windows to another drive without BSoD, even after a bunch of components have been swapped.

Current Specs after swapping hardware: [https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/36098791](https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/36098791)

Sensors while I ran benchmark, PerfCap Reason spike is during benchmark: [https://i.imgur.com/qs4rLY6.png](https://i.imgur.com/qs4rLY6.png)

Been screwing with this for a while with various fresh Windows installs between steps and changing out hardware, so here’s the rough timeline of what I can remember. Nothing has been clocked at any time.

\- Problem started as BSoD while playing a non-demanding game.

\-(I think) I did a reinstall and the BSoD started when I wasn’t gaming. I turned on dumps, here’s an old thread that includes them if you’re curious.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/jb3fl7/analyzed\_blue\_screen\_of\_death\_logs\_with\_windbg/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/jb3fl7/analyzed_blue_screen_of_death_logs_with_windbg/)

\- Temp was a little high, changed out stock cooler to ARCTIC Freezer 7 X

\-Ran Memtest86, no issues with RAM. Started changing module orders and eventually got the stop errors to stop for a month. I then put the RAM in the original slots and wasn’t able to replicate problem again (WTF?) and sent mine in under warranty.

\- Changed out RAM from Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2 X 8GB) DDR4 3600

\- FINALLY got things running smooth for a few days and then started getting crazy stutter in Windows and in games. Sometimes things like File Explorer or Firefox would crash. Sometimes I’d type and my cursor would freeze and then pop out all of the letters at once. Scrolling would sometimes freeze for a second.

\- Through GPU-Z, I noticed when the stutter would happen, an HDD that stored all my User files would spike hard in task manager. Moved files to C drive SSD and unplugged it and all other additional drives.

\- Was okay for a few hours (started planning on replacing the drive and setting up NAS as you’ll see my .text doc), then started again. Captured a minor instance of the stutter, notice that the Task Manager stutters when I resize it, and the menu bar flickers in my notepad. I was trying to show that when it stutters, you can see the CPU (task manager) and the GPU Clock frequencies spike during the stutter. GPU temp presumably spikes because of OBS studio recording.  [https://youtu.be/3HH7dAeuFys](https://youtu.be/3HH7dAeuFys)

\- Decided to try another smaller SSD that I have. Couldn’t get Windows to install on it because it would BSoD during installation. Afraid to reformat the larger SSD because it doesn’t blue screen right now.

\- Updated Bios, Reformatted everything for UEFI, turned off any legacy support in my Bios that I could find. Finally got it installed but it would BSoD every 10-30 minutes. Also stutters, but not as bad.

\- Replaced my GIGABYTE B450 AORUS PRO WIFI MoBo with MSI MAG B550 Gaming Plus today. When I was unscrewing the CPU cooler, the suction created by the thermal paste ripped the CPU out of the socket, ughhhhh, but nothing appears damaged. Fresh install looked something like this:

Reformatted and cleaned smaller SSD. Plugged in bare minimum to MoBO including CPU cooler, both RAM sticks, GPU, tower peripherals &amp; speaker, keyboard and mouse. BSoD during install, so attempted again and got it installed. Finally, in Windows, BSoD. In an act of desperation, I slapped in an old 550Ti GPU and still BSoD. Plugged in original SSD and Windows loads from that without the BSoD but with the lag. Not sure what to do at this point, might try a 256 GB SSD from a laptop that I have lying around I’ve changed out almost everything.  


Edit: Here are BSoD logs that are about 5 minutes apart that I was getting on a clean drive after an install.

"I'm looking at getting a new monitor and in the meantime I've been able to test out an Acer ED320QR with Freesync.

From what I understand, gsync Nvidia cards should be compatible with Freesync. And according to Nvidia's website gsync is supported on GTX 650 Ti cards or better (So my GTX 760 should support gsync).

https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/geforce/products/g-sync-monitors/g-sync-hdr-requirements/

I've updated the monitor and gpu with the latest drivers. I've enabled Freesync on the monitor (it's labeled ""Freesync Premium""). And I am using DisplayPort, not HDMI.

However the ""Set up gsync"" option does not appear in Nvidia Control Panel. I've watch some videos on this and it looks like there is supposed to be another option called ""Monitor Technology"" under Global Settings in the control panel that is set to ""G-SYNC"" . However I don't have this option either.

Am I missing something here? I've read some people say that Freesync only works on GTX 10 series or better. But then why would Nvidia say gsync is supported on 650 Ti or better?

Hey guys, so recently I upgraded from a gaming laptop to a prebuilt high-end pc and I was super excited that i'd be getting a massive upgrade, but it's been causing me more headaches than anything. I was unaware that PCs used two 3 pin jacks, so my 4 pin jack headphones that I used for voice chats on my laptop wouldn't do the trick, so then I proceeded by ordering the correct splitter.   
I finally got it yesterday and I thought my problems would be solved, but unfortunately, the mic wouldn't work and all it would pick up is the clicking of the buttons on the mic. I tested my brother's headset to see if it would work, and the mic and audio worked perfectly fine with the splitter.   
So I thought it might be something with the drivers so I ended up purchasing and using ""DriverFix"" and it showed that my Realtek audio drivers could be updated, so I went along with it and after uninstalling the driver and restarting my computer, voila my mic started getting picked up and I was thrilled. But after restarting my computer or even putting it to sleep overnight the mic would stop working and the only solution would be to uninstall the drivers again and restart so they would automatically reinstall. 

TLDR; Currently using a 4 pin headphone with a 3 pin splitter, mic doesn't work with **my specific headphones** unless I uninstall the driver and restart. After being put to sleep overnight or restarting the mic is no longer picked up again. Don't want to be stuck in this endless loop of uninstalling!",mic working deleting reinstalling driver need help hey guy recently upgraded gaming laptop prebuilt high end super excited getting massive upgrade causing headache unaware pc used 3 pin jack 4 pin jack headphone used voice chat laptop trick proceeded ordering correct splitter finally got yesterday thought problem solved unfortunately mic work pick clicking button mic tested brother's headset work mic audio worked perfectly fine splitter thought driver ended purchasing using driverfix showed realtek audio driver updated went uninstalling driver restarting computer voila mic started getting picked thrilled restarting computer putting sleep overnight mic stop working solution uninstall driver restart automatically reinstall tldr currently using 4 pin headphone 3 pin splitter mic work specific headphone unless uninstall driver restart sleep overnight restarting mic longer picked want stuck endless loop uninstalling,0

"Before anything else, I reinstalled this pump back onto the original Asus X99 motherboard it came off and it functions properly on that motherboard. Pump failure is not my issue and I took the time to verify that the pump does in fact still work. I borrowed another Corsair H115i AIO from a friend, installed it and it also does not operate on the MSI mobo, but works properly on the ASUS X99 mobo.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I know this is a long post but I want to put up all the info I have to avoid suggestions I've already implemented. I appreciate any help offered as I've run out of ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a new build, and Windows is not yet installed. The system posts properly and I can enter BIOS. All case fans operate properly and as the CPU temps rise the case fans are all ramping up as they are supposed to. Only the AIO pump does not operate as it should.

&amp;#x200B;

The cooler is a Corsair H110i GTX. It's old, I know, but it looks good with the new parts and more importantly it still does a good job with no air bubble noise. I would prefer not to replace it if I can avoid it. The cost isn't my concern, rather the quality of newer AIOs is lower and they all look pretty awful.

&amp;#x200B;

The cooler has 4 leads. The USB lead I have plugged into JUSB1 header. The Sata power lead is plugged into the PSU through a SATA power cable. The fan lead splits to run the radiator's two 140mm fans. The single wire ending in a 3-pin plug is connected to the CPU\_Fan\_1 header.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the same way I installed it on my previous X99 mobo. But my results are not the same on the MSI motherboard and I can't seem to figure out why.

&amp;#x200B;

* The Corsair logo illuminates properly. 
* The radiator fans both activate properly.
* The pump does not activate.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately without the pump I have a limited time to fart around in the MSI bios which I am very unfamiliar with. I'd also prefer not not run the CPU at 100C while fumbling around. Of course since there is a ticking clock as soon as I turn on the PC my IQ is reduced by half and I lose my ability to control a mouse because reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

What I have already managed to try based on local suggestions:

* Connect a regular fan to CPU\_Fan\_1 to see if a fan runs off that header. Fan operates properly, header is not faulty.
* Connect the AIO pump 3-pin lead to the PUMP\_FAN1 header. No change, PUMP\_FAN1 header will also operate a fan properly and is not faulty.
* Connect the AIO pump 3-pin lead to a SYS\_FAN lead. No change.
* Connect the AIO pump 3-pin lead to the PSU directly using a molex to 3-pin adapter. No change, using voltage tester direct power from the Molex plug is not 12V. I believe the pump needs a 12V signal. 
* In BIOS switch fan from PWM to DC. I have done this but unlike the BIOS in my previous PC there is no ""apply"" button so I'm not sure the changes I'm making are even taking effect.
* Allow the CPU to reach higher temps to see if the pump kicks in at higher temps - Eventually I get a message that the CPU is overheating and the PC shuts down. I would prefer not to have that happen again and would prefer not to even attempt another similar strategy.
* In BIOS switch the voltage manually to 12V. I've entered BIOS several times and as I am unfamiliar with the MSI BIOS have not found how/where to do this. The CPU temps start climbing over 90C and I have to shut down.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on about 6 hours of reading last night, I'm thinking the AIO waterpump needs a 12V signal to activate and is not getting a full 12V signal. The waterpump should be running 100% at all times unlike the fans and requires a simple 12V signal to activate. The mobo does not support my ancient AIO because it doesn't use the current standard AIO hookup. As the signal cable connected to CPU\_FAN\_1 is a single one direction signal wire , the mobo is not detecting power draw from CPU\_Fan\_1 and therefore is not sending a signal to the pump to fire up.",aio pump activate msi gaming carbon z490 motherboard reinstalled pump original asus x99 motherboard came function properly motherboard pump failure took time verify pump fact work borrowed corsair h115i aio friend installed operate msi mobo work properly asus x99 mobo amp x200b know long post want info avoid suggestion implemented appreciate help offered run idea amp x200b new build window installed post properly enter bios case fan operate properly cpu temp rise case fan ramping supposed aio pump operate amp x200b cooler corsair h110i gtx old know look good new part importantly good job air bubble noise prefer replace avoid cost concern quality newer aios lower look pretty awful amp x200b cooler 4 lead usb lead plugged jusb1 header sata power lead plugged psu sata power cable fan lead split run radiator's 140mm fan single wire ending 3 pin plug connected cpu _fan _1 header amp x200b way installed previous x99 mobo result msi motherboard figure amp x200b corsair logo illuminates properly radiator fan activate properly pump activate amp x200b unfortunately pump limited time fart msi bios unfamiliar prefer run cpu 100c fumbling course ticking clock soon turn iq reduced half lose ability control mouse reason amp x200b managed try based local suggestion connect regular fan cpu _fan _1 fan run header fan operates properly header faulty connect aio pump 3 pin lead pump _fan1 header change pump _fan1 header operate fan properly faulty connect aio pump 3 pin lead sys _fan lead change connect aio pump 3 pin lead psu directly using molex 3 pin adapter change using voltage tester direct power molex plug 12v believe pump need 12v signal bios switch fan pwm dc unlike bios previous apply button sure change making taking effect allow cpu reach higher temp pump kick higher temp eventually message cpu overheating shuts prefer happen prefer attempt similar strategy bios switch voltage manually 12v entered bios time unfamiliar msi bios cpu temp start climbing 90c shut amp x200b based 6 hour reading night thinking aio waterpump need 12v signal activate getting 12v signal waterpump running 100 time unlike fan requires simple 12v signal activate mobo support ancient aio use current standard aio hookup signal cable connected cpu _fan _1 single direction signal wire mobo detecting power draw cpu _fan _1 sending signal pump,0

Then I go to plug it In and boot it up to see how it looks. I press the power button and nothing happens no fan spin up no click. This immediately worried me.

"My Macbook has had a screen problem for over half a year. I've had 3 screen-changes;

1st time: Lines started appearing at the bottom of my screen. The longer the computer was on, the more of the screen, the lines would cover. I paid $800 for a new screen, but the problem very quickly returned

2nd time: I took the computer back to the repair-place, and they said it was a problem with the heating, so they had a look at it, and I picked it up the next day. And the problem was still there. Then they blamed the display I think? So again, hey had it for about a day, I picked it up the next day, and the problem was still there, so they changed the screen a second time.

3rd time: It didn't take long before the lines started appearing, but at this time, the school year had started, and I am very depedent on my cimpuer for my school work. We use computers in every subject, for every test and to every assignment, so I learned to live with the lines on the screen. Often those screen would fill up half of the screen during a school day. One day though, while I was charging, the computer started smoking. So I went back to the place and told them that my computer smoked when it was charging, and that the screen was still broken. They looked at it, and told me that one of the ports were burned and the other one was fine-ish. They kept the computer for a couple of days and found out that the charger was at fault, they said that the charger (original apple charger) probably created some interference, which caused the lines on the screen, so I went and bought a new charger. When I charged with the new charger, the lines still appeared on my screen, so I went back with the computer. They kept the computer for 2 weeks this time, and changed the screen for a 3rd time, and finally, there were no lines.

But when I tried to charge my computer, with the new charger in the port that wasn't burned, smoke came from it again. The new charger was a sinox charger, which the repair place had said was a good alternative to the original apple charger. I figured that maybe the sinox charger was making my computer smoke because it was a copy, and not original apple, so I borrowed my mate's orignal apple charger, but her charger quickly started to smell burnt as well.

"I've been searching the internet for some hours now and I can't find someone in a similar situation.

My Lacie (rugged 3.0) external hard drive was connected to my computer, while all of a sudden my Macbook froze and the spinning pinwheel of death started spinning. After 30 seconds, I panicked, and unplugged the cable which unfroze the computer and everything seemed normal. I had been clicking like a maniac everywhere while the mac was frozen, and everything I had been clicking on for 30 seconds, opened up (different files on my desktop etc.). After that, I plugged the hard drive in again, and same thing happened. I unplugged again, and when I plugged it back, my mac wouldn't recognize Lacie anymore. I've tried everything of the basic stuff (different computers, cables etc.), but nothing makes Lacie appear again.

However, Lacie appears on the ""USB device tree"" under USB 3.1 bus. The hard drive itself is running smoothly and does not make any off-sounding noice.

Do anyone here have had a similar experience, or might know what have happened? I know I was reckless and stupid when plugging and unplugging Lacie when my Mac froze, but any help or advice would help.

"Heya, so the following problem is a result of a mistake i made like 3 years ago, following several years of me just ignoring it in hopes of it eventually sorting itself out.

So three years ago I was using the Spotify windows App, and one day it had some issue (i think it was something like it would just play about 20 songs on loop despite me playing a playlist that was way longer than that or something, but thats not really relevant.) anyways a friend of mine had had the same issue and he said he fixed it by reinstalling the app; seems logical. So when we we're done gaming he went to bed and I thought I would just fix it real quick before going to sleep aswell.Now, i was very new to pc, so i didn't particularly know what to do, I knew most apps i had wanted to delete thus far had a delete option in the app itself, but spotify didnt.Now this is where i fucked up, i just thought i'd delete the files. Bad idea.It was deleting spotify's files, when it hit an administrator file, which required an extra confirmation and had the classic warning that wrote something along the lines of ''deleting this could fuck ya system up'' i ofcourse, didn't like the sound of that, and did not delete those.

Then i went to reinstall spotify; it did it, no problem.. however now there was no longer any music on it. My playlists and everything were there, but they were completely empty.  


I just switched to the WebApp instead. Now in hindsight i know i should've used the delete feature in the ''apps &amp; features'' tab in the system setting. But i didn't, and it no longer shows up there, when i reinstall the app it just deletes the one it just installed but those files that i didnt delete 3 years ago remain. 

&amp;#x200B;

But now it's like 3 years later, the WebApp fuckin' sucks and i want the Windows App back.I checked, it still does the same thing.Is there any way to salvage this? do i just delete those admin files and hope for the best or is there some less spooky way of doing this?

Thanks for taking the time to read this  :)",spotify window app wont work foolishly deleted wrong 3 year ago heya following problem result mistake 3 year ago following year ignoring hope eventually sorting year ago using spotify window app day think play 20 song loop despite playing playlist way longer thats really relevant anyways friend said fixed reinstalling app logical gaming went bed thought fix real quick going sleep aswell new particularly know knew apps wanted delete far delete option app spotify didnt fucked thought delete file bad idea deleting spotify's file hit administrator file required extra confirmation classic warning wrote line ''deleting fuck ya up'' ofcourse sound delete went reinstall spotify problem longer music playlist completely switched webapp instead hindsight know used delete feature ''apps amp features'' tab setting longer show reinstall app deletes installed file didnt delete 3 year ago remain amp x200b 3 year later webapp fuckin' suck want window app checked thing way salvage delete admin file hope best spooky way thanks taking time read,0

"Hello!

I am currently attempting to help remotely troubleshoot my sister's PC - it has been crashing frequently and my theory was the CPU as the current cooling seems questionable. However, I was astounded upon installing HWM when reading the temperature sensors, particularly as this was just during normal running without any stress testing:

Package: Min: 9C Max: 56C

Core: Min: 58C Max: 105C

Obviously something is wrong with the sensors as the room is very warm and that 9C reading can't be possible, and that 105 is concerning to say the least! I had my sister check the heatsink - it is running and feels warm but not hot. All other temperature sensors within the motherboard report between 20-33C. What's likely the issue here? Obviously if the 105C value is correct then this is a big problem and likely the culprit of the frequent crashes, but what could have caused this whopping temperature difference and why doesn't the unit feel hot? My guess would be something is wrong with the heatsink contact, but how would that explain the other sensor readings?

" Hi I'm having a confusing issue with my bluetooth.

My wireless mouse continues to work though. I have two bluetooth dongles and two bluetooth headphones, both of which work on my phone (in the same location my computer is at).

"I built a PC a few years ago (specs below) in Indonesia and it's been working great until I moved to the US last year. I am not sure exactly when it started but I have this issue where **if I leave my computer off for a few days and try to turn it back on the fans spin and the keyboard lights up and my display turns on but shows a black screen.** I can only get it to boot properly if I shut the PC off and turn it back on again after this initial no POST boot. I get a red light next to ""VGA"" on the msi ez debug lights when the computer boots, but only for a few seconds. I don't hear any beep.

The VGA fan plate fell off because of cheap plastic screw threads, but the wiring is fine as the fans on the VGA still work. I am connecting the fan plate to the VGA with rubber bands. 

I was using the wrong cable with the power supply for a while but switched to the right cable and the problem still occurs.

I have ran the windows memory diag and everything was fine.

I have reseated the VGA and disconnected the wifi adapter and cd drive.

I have reseated the RAM.

I have started the PC with no USB peripherals and the problem persists.

I have updated Nvidia drivers.

I thought it may have been the voltage switch between 240v in Indonesia and 110v in the US that caused it but I used a transformer to up the voltage and the problem still happened. Also the psu can take both 110 and 240.

I have cleared CMOS and reset BIOS recently and I am going to leave the PC off for a few days to see if the problem persists.

"I’ll be building a new PC in a couple of weeks once all the parts arrive. My current rig was working perfectly fine until I decided to remove one of the GPU’s to sell it.

Current Rig Specs
- CPU i7-6700K
- GPU Gigabyte 980 Ti (was two in SLI)
- Mobo MSI Z170A
- OS Windows 10

So like I said the PC was working fine until I removed one of the 980 Ti’s a couple of weeks ago then I started getting crashes while gaming. I used DDU to completely remove all the GPU drivers, reinstalled fresh drivers, and used MSI live update to update anything associated with the motherboard. This appeared to fix the problem for about a week.

Last night I was playing a game for about an hour, then exited so I could let my toddler do her midnight pee, went to start up the same game and crashed like 5 mins in. My game room was a little warmer than usual so I thought maybe the GPU was overheating. I used OC Guru II to adjust my fan curve to a more aggressive setting, then I crashed immediately on game startup.

Now I can’t even boot into Windows at all. I can boot into safe mode but safe mode won’t allow me to run OC Guru II to change the setting back.

During the original crashes I used WhoCrashed to determine it’s definitely a GPU issue. All the dump logs point towards that being the issue, but I’m stumped as to why I can’t even get into Windows anymore.

FWIW, I double checked all power connectors for everything in the rig, made sure my GPU and RAM are seated properly, all fans seems to be spinning ok, no debug LEDs are going off.

"I'm having a weird issue with my USB-C dock, an [Icybox ib-dk4050-cpd](https://www.raidsonic.de/en/standards/searchresults.php?we_objectID=6089). When I connect a laptop to it, the colour reproduction on the external monitor, attached to the dock's HDMI port, seems fine, except that the top and bottom end on the monochrome range blends together completely. This does not happen when I use the built-in HDMI of the laptop.

Here's an approximation of the problem: https://i.imgur.com/RVfwpHO.png It's really noticeable in my e-mail program, which uses a faint grey as background colour every other row. It's invisible when I use the dock, except when another window's shadow darkens it. Then the striping is visible in the shadow, but nowhere else.

I've also taken a photo, the whole image should be bars of different shades, but the difference is only visible on the left: https://i.imgur.com/oYLyPJU.jpg

The problem doesn't happen with colours. A super-dark blue (\#000002) next to black still looks different, so does an ever so slightly lighter blue.

Troubleshooting steps and research done:

 * Tried multiple laptops, both Thinkpads though.
 * Tried Windows and Linux, same result.
 * Tried updating the dock's firmware.

"Hey, I hope somebody here can help me.

Some background:

I have recently bought a new video card and M.2. I was also still running windows 7 so I thought that might be a nice time to update. So I update windows 7 to 10 and got a licence connected to my windows account.

After installing the M.2 and the new video card I was able to install windows 10 from a USB drive to the M.2. Unfortunately my previous hard drives in Raid 1 were no longer visible. I was able to unplug the other two drives, my previous boot drive(ssd) and a storage drive  and use diskmanager to enable foreign disk and got the info on my hard drive visible again. That was the state this problem occurred in.

What happened:

So I started the PC, it booted properly from M.2 in Windows 10. I started ANNO 1800, played for a bit and all of a sudden the PC froze. Then a blue screen, it gave an error message but I was focused to try to get the QR read but I wasn't fast enough. So I thought, ok, that can happen, let's restart. But now when I try to boot from the M.2 it said: no boot device found (or something). So I thought I would see if I could repair it, to no avail. Then I thought, I will try to reinstall Windows 10 like I installed it before. It said: can't install to that drive because it's a GPT drive, which may be possible, but how did it install before then? Then I pressed format drive to see if that would make a difference, but it didn't.

So now I'm pretty lost. What can I do next? The M.2 is recognized in the BIOS, it just won't boot and it won't let me install Windows 10 to that one again. I'm using the  *Windows 10* media creation from windows.

My MB: GA-Z97X-SLI  
M.2: Samsung 980 PRO 500GB  
OS: Windows 10 Pro

I read I should turn on UEFI, It says DUAL BIOS/UEFI in my BIOS screen. I think it's turned on but maybe not. I wouldn't know where else to turn it on.

I've put Windows as flair. It used to work before so I doubt it's a hardware problem, it appears a windows thing to me.

Any help is much appreciated.

"I'm a technician, I build stuff, I fix stuff, and I fix the stuff other people built themselves, a couple of years ago though a fellow technician offered me the chance to buy a load of stuff from them that either they couldn't fix, couldn't use, or just didn't have the space for anyway, all for like £50. One of the things was a complete PC which had been plugged in during a lighting strike and wouldn't work properly since.

Details of the PC:
Intel i3-6100
Gigabyte h110m-h
8GB DDR4 
480GB SSD
GTX 1050
A cheapo CIT SFX 400w PSU

The issue was the PC would lockup at a random interval between 1 minute and 5 minutes after boot up, when it did it would corrupt windows to the point that you'd need to reinstall from scratch.

He assumed it was a faulty mobo (can't remember why that conclusion) so brought a new identical one, and when that didn't fix it gave up and gave me both.

I swapped out all the components and tested in several different configurations etc, and tested each of those components in sperate computers, all of which where fine, and I've in-fact sold most of those parts since.

So at this point I was sure it was the CPU, in further testing I found that it works fine with Ubuntu, the UEFI works fine and you can even use the CPU to update the bios without issue, windows you can install using the CPU and will work fine in safe mode, however as soon as you boot up any version of Windows normally you run into the issue and it's corrupted all over again. Limiting the CPU to one core also makes no difference. It also passes every CPU test you can throw at it.

So go ahead, tell me what the hell could be the issue with the CPU and what setting etc could be changed to make it work like it does in safe mode or with Ubuntu.

Ok this thing has been bothering me for quite a while. Even if I snooze it, it still comes back after a while. It's not that I want to disable some important feature of Windows; I am aware I have update waiting to be installed, it's just that I prefer to keep my laptop running for long times without restarts and it's always worked out fine for me, but now it essentialy forces me to restart every few days because there are always some updates.

I've looked around the internet and there are some suggestions as to there being a possibilty of turning it off via Group Policy. I went in there and tweaked various things and it didn't work, but I'll be honest with you and say that I don't fully understand what those policies do (the descriptions are often very confabulated). I consider myself a power user but the level of confabulation is just too dense for me to understand anything basically.

Can somebody please enlighten me and tell me which exact setting do I tweak in order for this to go away?

I have had the computer for 5 days, used for about 3 hours a day, and it has crashed a total of 4 times. These crashes have so far happened only while gaming. I have used HWInfo to monitor my GPU temperature, and the maximum it has hit is 83 degrees celsius while gaming on maximum settings, 4k, on Shadow of the Tomb Raider.

The 4 shutdowns happened on the following games, all settings maxed out, at 4k resolution:

1. Shadow of the Tomb Raider
2. Dota 2
3. Final Fantasy 14 (twice)

The PC turns on automatically after the shutdown. 

During the last shutdown with Final Fantasy 14, I had HWInfo record a log, and when I looked at the final record before it crashed, the GPU temperature is at 75 degrees celsius.

I'm a little stump as to what the issue might be. I have Googled and there seems to be 2 potential reasons for this shutdown: GPU too hot such that it forced a shutdown &amp; Not enough power from the PSU.

Could I seek some advice over here? Is there a program I could use to track what may have caused the shutdown?

"Hello fellow user, I don't know if this is a hardware or a software problem. So what happened was, I was playing Assassin's Creed Unity, and my PC suddenly froze. I was wearing the headphones, and there was a static repeating. So I waited 2 minutes, tried Alt-Tab and Ctrl-Alt-Del, but it just wouldn't budge, so I tried to turn off my PC. I clicked the power button, but it wouldn't turn it off too. So I went to the back and turned off the power to the whole PC, eventually turning everything off. So I tried to turn it on again, and the PC turned on, but my monitor wasn't receiving it. The fans were working, the motherboard had the lights, the hard disk had the lights, my RGB strip in the case was working too, but only the monitor wasn't receiving it. Then I tried to turn it off by the power button, and it wasn't turning off. I thought it was a back power supply problem, so I tried a wired mouse, and it was lighting up. Only my wired keyboard and my monitor weren't receiving the power. The PC is mostly clean, I tried different HDMI cables, different monitors, but it doesn't work.

All in all, the PC turns on but the power button wouldn't turn it off, and the monitor shows the 'No device connected' thingy.

And before you wonder, Assassin's Creed Unity isn't a beefy game for my PC, I can play AAA games that came out this year on Very High/Ultra graphics. So it isn't related to this.

"Hi, my young kids were issues chromebooks from their school for remote learning. The school blocks most harmful websites, but they allow youtube because some teachers assign videos.

Hi all. I'm pulling my hair out trying to figure this out. I started streaming on Twitch using my Rode NT-USB. For the first two days my mic was perfect. Then out of nowhere just yesterday when I wanted to stream, there was a static sound whenever I spoke into my mic.

Here's a sample recording. Really dragged out my words so you can hear it. [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1105neVjfZB2UuuuXV6RSJsRhNC6ORP4N/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1105neVjfZB2UuuuXV6RSJsRhNC6ORP4N/view?usp=sharing)

Again, it's only when I plug this into my Windows 10 computer that it gets outputted with this static. If I plug in headphones directly into my mic, or if I plug my mic into my Macbook, it sounds fine.

Someone PLEASE help me with this. I'm just at a loss. I actually did an entire reboot of my Windows 10 computer to see if that would help (thinking it was something screwy that got updated) and the problem is persisting. A more tech-savvy person I spoke with said that it seems like an issue of electrical interference, but I'm not sure how to fix it or what really changed since I was doing the same thing I did on the first two days of streaming without issue.",help static noise speaking rode nt usb microphone started yesterday hi pulling hair trying figure started streaming twitch using rode nt usb day mic perfect yesterday wanted stream static sound spoke mic sample recording really dragged word hear usp sharing usp sharing plug window 10 computer get outputted static plug headphone directly mic plug mic macbook sound fine help loss actually entire reboot window 10 computer help thinking screwy got updated problem persisting tech savvy person spoke said electrical interference sure fix really changed thing day streaming,0

"So when I first got my Switch, I also had a 32GB micro SD card to use (already a mistake but way past that now). I got really tired of constantly running out of space and archiving games to make room for new ones.
 
So I decided to buy a larger micro SD card. I looked up how to transfer data from micro SD card to another micro SD card and I did the steps. I formatted the new SD card, copied the Nintendo folder from my old SD card to my (Mac) desktop, inserted the new SD card, moved files from old SD card to new one and replaced the files, then popped that sucker back into my Switch and...there were issues.
 
It recognized that it was a 256GB micro SD card and that files had been inserted.
But, when I went to click on a game, it flashed a message that said “This game is currently not downloaded to this console. If it was downloaded onto a different micro SD card, power down and insert that card.” Obviously that’s not what I’d want to do considering I had supposedly already moved the files to the other SD card. So I don’t understand why it would’ve given that message.
 
So I kinda gave up and just assumed that maybe it had a hard time transferring between cards of different brands (SanDisk &amp; Samsung). But yesterday, there was a Black Friday sale on SanDisk micro SD cards, so I decided to buy one to test my theory. I followed basically the same steps, and everything seemed to be totally normal.
 
But just to try something different, I inserted my old SD card and archived the software on it, hoping that maybe I’d be able to redownload it all without receiving that same message as last time. What I realized too late was that I was kinda mixing methods, and therefore kinda put myself in a bigger pickle. So I put my new SD card back in, tried to click on a game, same exact message.
 
I really have no idea what I’m doing wrong (except the mixing methods thing). Have I completely screwed everything up or is there still a way to fix this?

"Hi everyone, I just built my new pc about a week ago and I've had a lot of audio crackling and popping whenever any kind of sound is playing.
Everything in the build is brand new except for the GPU, which is about three years old. All external accessories are exactly the same as with my previous build, which did not have any audio issues.

The crackling is present on every audio device I've checked: two different headphones, two monitors and speakers in combination with the rear panel 3.5mm, front panel 3.5mm, multiple USB ports and Display Port. I don't currently have devices/cables on hand to try HDMI or S/PDIF.

Things I've tried so far:

* Updated/reinstalled audio drivers

* Tried older audio drivers

* Reinstalled windows 10

* Changed the audio format to lower frequencies

* Disabled audio enhancements

* Disabled exclusive control mode

* Changed power settings to high performance power mode

* Checked DPC latency using LatencyMon which said the problem might be related to power management or CPU throttling.
Turned off CPU power throttling through a registry key and cmd commands, no dice.

"Hello fellow redditors! First time pc build here. I bought the 850w 80+gold Super Flower Leadex III psu to be installed into my pc. When I first took it out, it made a clunky sound, like something loose was moving around inside. So I gently shook it and it was still making the sound. Nonetheless, I installed it on the pc, completed the build, turned it on, 2 to 3 days later, nothing has happened so far. It might be a bad and dumb idea for me to do but I didn't know anything.

Did a quick search and a lot of people suggested on other forums to just rma it. Should I be worried about anything? Maybe it would be broken down a month from now or something and affect all the parts? Should I take it out immediately before anything happens??? What should I do, help me please!

First time ever posting on reddit so please bear with me. Exactly a week ago today I bought a name brand TV. I am not sure if I am allowed to drop brand names here but it starts with an ""S"" and has the past participle of the word ""sing"" in it. It is a 55inch QLED TV.

**ISSUE:** After purchasing said TV from the blue and yellow electronic store and setting it up and using it for about a week I noticed this white ""dust"", if you will, that began to form on the back panel of the TV and around the screen edges. Upon closer inspection it looks like this so called dust has outlined some of the interior components on the back panel. 

I contacted the TV brand's tech support and they had never seen anything like it. They told me to wipe it off and see if it comes back. I did not do that. I took it back to the blue and yellow electronic store and they, of course, had never seen anything like that but they thought it was defective so I got it swapped out with another TV, same brand and model etc. I am worried that this TV will begin doing the same thing as I think I can see some of this dust starting to form again. I got this new replacement TV yesterday.

**Facts:** I am meticulous with all my electronics in terms of keeping them clean and not putting them in places where they will get stuff on them. This TV was on a TV stand, not mounted. There is about 7-8in between the back panel and the wall. There is an air vent on the ceiling to the right of the tv and there is a door that goes to my balcony on the left of the tv. The router is on the right side of the tv and the modem is on the left side. Other than watching TV I play a lot of XBOX which is located underneath the TV in a little cubby on the stand.

I live in the Midwest so it is typical Midwest late fall weather. The TV was not exposed to anything. I had a 55inch regular LED TV in the same spot and never had this issue. Also, I am pretty good about dusting too. I have ruled out as many scenario's as I could. I do not believe it is mold based on my research so I have ruled that out.

I consider my self on a tech savviness scale of 1-10 at about a 6.4 to 7.1 depending on the technology. My curiosity has got the best of me and it is going to bug me until I figure out if it is something I am doing wrong or if I just got a faulty unit.

"I changed my motherboard, CPU and RAM + installed windows 10 (from windows 7)
I installed windows 10 then changed motherboard/CPU/ram

Working fine except when I plug a USB device, windows does not see it until I reboot my PC. If a USB device is working correctly and I plug it out and in, it will not work (mouse, keyboard, headset, *external hard drive* ) until I reboot my pc. My mouse software stopped working and my headset does not allow to adjust microphone DB boost (it should, now stuck at 0db)

When shutting down, put to sleep or rebooting, windows start shutting down correctly then monitor(s) shut down but pc stays on: fans still working (low), motherboard led still on.

*  PC is unresponsive (keyboard/mouse does nothing)
* *single* press of  power button does nothing, long press shut down as expected.
* Reboot button on my case still work and reboot as expected (windows act as if nothing wrong happened)

After ~5min, my screen powers on and just display a black screen. At this point :

* a single press of the power button instantly shut down my pc (as if it was expecting this)
* if shut down, everything is normal when booting windows (whether I put it to sleep or shut down)
* I tried letting this state go and nothing happened (black screen on, fan running low) after ~10 hours

I did not reinstall or reset Windows but now wondering if necessary. Online advice doesn't seem to agree on a reset or not and I am reluctant to fully reset this pc as it hold a lot of installed apps, files and environment Path. I am unsure if the issue comes from windows &amp; motherboard or motherboard drivers or a combination of both

CPU: Intel Core i5-4690K   -&gt;     Intel Core i5-9600K

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

A very rare issue also happen sometimes and it's hard to describe and I am unsure they are related

* After a random amount of time (10min to 3+ hours), if I let my computer without ""user"" input for a few min, it will freeze, opened app become unresponsive and newly opened either don't open or become unresponsive. Only fix known to me is rebooting from the case button.

* Games opened will still work when this issue occur but will fail to close correctly and/thus saving data (eg can't save games when it occur)
* If opening Task manager, it will display 100% CPU being taken but will not report any app/exe using CPU  (and will become unresponsive shortly after)
* If Apps/Games are opened, they will *NOT* lag as if 100% Cpu was taken
* If I had my (xbox) controller plugged-in when booting my PC and it is not powered on, this issue will happen 100% of the time. If my controller is powered on, the issue will NOT happen (if not plugged in, it can happen)
* issue occur rarely and unsure of what could be triggering it

1. Tried manually shutting down the PC to invoke Troubleshoot menu. Diagnostic/repair tool fail to repair anything.
2. Unplug HDD so I am left with SSD that has the OS. Reset PC with Troubleshoot menu. Black screen issue still present.
3. Made a USB boot drive. Reinstalled Windows 10 Home. Successfully setup Windows 10 Home. Successfully updated drivers and what not (with a couple of mandatory restarts). Black screen issue seems fixed. But..
4. Plug HDD back in to test with reinstalled OS. Black screen issue returns.
5. Unplug HDD again. Reboot PC with just SSD. Black screen issue is still present.
6. So I repeated step 3 again. With HDD unplugged, I used the USB boot drive again to reinstall Windows. Black screen issue is gone.

I just bought a new 700 watt EVGA bronze power supply, and an RX 5700xt and put it in my computer. It was working fine for a week or so, but yesterday after booting the computer in the morning my second monitor was completely green, and my first monitor was flickering heavily. I decided to reseat the graphics card, clean drivers with DDU and fresh install to a stable version, and turn my PC on its side (turned it while it was off as not to dmg the HDD), and now its working again, but the screen flickers randomly and whenever I lightly tap my pc with two fingers, it flickers! 

I don't have another GPU or PSU so I can test which one of these isn't working right, but I have until Jan 16 to return both of them so I would appreciate any insight. I suspected the GPU was too heavy and I needed a brace, which is why my entire PC is on its side right now. Is there anything else I can do except return this GPU and buy Nvidia?

"I have an AMD wraith spire CPU cooler, and I want to be able to change the ring rgb colour. I don’t have any argb headers on my b450 tomahawk motherboard, so if I plug it into the rgb header it only stays on one colour.

The led controller is plugged into a 12V DC power cable. However, it is not working and not even turning on (to any colour), and the cooler ring will not be controlled by the led controller.

\-I reseated the SATA cables (Whenever PC doesn't start again, my Drive LED doesn't blink, or do anything for that matter, so I thought the issue is with the drives, it didn't help however)
