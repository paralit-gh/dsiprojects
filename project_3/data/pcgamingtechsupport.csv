Many of you come here for one reason: ""I can't game""

|RAM not as fast as it could be|Check your BIOS/UEFI settings for a [XMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_presence_detect#XMP) Setting. Many systems have it disabled by default.|Enable XMP|
|GPU/CPU is getting too hot|Airflow is suboptimal? Check out [this Guide](https://computerinfobits.com/pc-airflow-optimization/) on how to improve it|Improve airflow inside your case|
|Bad FPS after swapping GPU's|Check to make sure your HDMI or DisplayPort Cable is plugged in correctly.|Your monitor should connect to your GPU, not your onboard video card.|
|Bad everything after cloning a drive that had your OS on it|Stop cloning and reinstall windows.|seriously, stop cloning your OS drives people|
|Clicking noise|check for lose wires, locate the sound|Whatever clicks, if its not a cable hitting a fan, replace that part ASAP.|
|PC randomly restarts|Remove recently added parts and see if the problem persists. If it does, replace all parts one by one in this order of probability -&gt; RAM, PSU, MoBo, CPU, EndUser|Replace faulty hardware|
|Bad smell|Do not touch a thing, unplug the maschine from power and call an expert. We know gaming is fun, but its not worth your life.|Current can kill, call an expert for your own safety when dealing with possible short-circuited hardware.|
|BlueScreen|Find out what the BSOD Code means and act accordingly. We recommend using [this list of BSOD Codes](https://www.lifewire.com/blue-screen-error-codes-4065576) for investigation.|Replace or repair faulty soft or hardware.|
|BlueScreen - Advanced|Every BlueScreen will (if this function is enabled on your maschine) produce a ""minidump"". Which is similar to an error log.

,pcgamingtechsupport," Hi there,  


Looking for some help with my Alienware 17 R4, getting hopeless. Although I've made slight improvements with things like changing options in bios, throttlestop disabling BD PROCHOT, undervolting, changing power management percentage, monitoring temps and usuage using mwinfo etc etc etc. So It appears when I clock my 2.8ghz to 3.5-3.6ghz I get the same performance in HEAVEN benchmark as when it's at 2.8, except my temps get up to over 90 degrees celcius. So that's why I put my power management down to 85-90%, and my temps remain in the 80s, and my performance is very similar.  


I don't quite seem to be getting the same performance I use to be getting while gaming (warzone and pubg).  


Just today I ran LatencyMon and noticed I Was getting some really high numbers, so I disabled a couple dell drivers and seen the battery ACPI was giving me high numbers so I disabled that. That seemed to improve performance slightly, but doing all this seems like its just a bandage to my situation and I'm not resolving the root cause. Considering I use to get much better performance, I'm not sure what it could be.  


My 17 R4 specs are as followed;  
AMD Radeon(TM) RX 570 with 8GB GDDR5  
16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 at 2400MHz  
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ (Q uad-Core, 6MB Cache, up to 3.8 GHz w/ Turbo Boost)

,pcgamingtechsupport,"So yesterday I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgamingtechsupport/comments/k2qpcg/cant_boot_pc_cant_even_enter_bios/) about [this screen](http://imgur.com/a/6oPhOQ8) I was getting on boot, people said it was probably an issue with windows. 

Well, I removed my storage devices and I was still getting that screen, so I figured I'd remove the ram and put it back to see if that did anything. Now when I boot, the onboard LEDs on the mobo can't get past the first yellow DRAM light, and I get no screen at all. Thoughts?

Specs:

- AMD Ryzen 5 3600
- Pulse Sapphire RX5600XT
- Asus TUF Gaming X570-Plus Wifi
- Seasonic S12III-650
- Corsair MP600 1TB NVME
- G.SKILL Ripjaws DDR4-3600 8gbx2

EDIT: I tried to boot with only one of the ram sticks at a time in the recommended slot. For one of the sticks, I got stuck at the DRAM led and saw no signal detected on the screen, for the other stick, I got that purple screen again. I'm guessing the ram is the problem?

EDIT 2: I tried it again because I wasn't convinced I had the ram properly seated and both sticks of ram seem to be giving that purple screen now. I guess I hadn't inserted one of them properly when I was trying them just one at a time before.

&lt;p&gt;Well, I removed my storage devices and I was still getting that screen, so I figured I&amp;#39;d remove the ram and put it back to see if that did anything. Now when I boot, the onboard LEDs on the mobo can&amp;#39;t get past the first yellow DRAM light, and I get no screen at all. Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMD Ryzen 5 3600&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pulse Sapphire RX5600XT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asus TUF Gaming X570-Plus Wifi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seasonic S12III-650&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corsair MP600 1TB NVME&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;G.SKILL Ripjaws DDR4-3600 8gbx2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I tried to boot with only one of the ram sticks at a time in the recommended slot. For one of the sticks, I got stuck at the DRAM led and saw no signal detected on the screen, for the other stick, I got that purple screen again. I&amp;#39;m guessing the ram is the problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2: I tried it again because I wasn&amp;#39;t convinced I had the ram properly seated and both sticks of ram seem to be giving that purple screen now. I guess I hadn&amp;#39;t inserted one of them properly when I was trying them just one at a time before. This makes me think its probably not the ram?&lt;/p&gt;

,pcgamingtechsupport,"I have a Frankenstein PC made up of whatever I got cheaply over the last 10 years or so.  So it's not really surprising it has issues.  But I thought I'd see if anyone has a recommendation, aside from just, ""buy a new one."" :D

A friend of mine was getting rid of his GeForce GTX 760, so I recently stuck that in.  It's taking a lot more power than my previous GTX 650Ti.  That brought me up to just meet the minimum requirements to play ""Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.""  So I downloaded that and have been trying to play it.  But the whole computer shuts off once the game starts at 1080p.  I turned down the resolution a bit to 900p, and was able to play the first level until the boss.  Once the boss appeared it blinked off again.

Other intensive games don't work either, I can't even get to the main menu of Overload for some reason.  But Tempest 4000 works.

When it turns off I can't turn it immediately back on.  I have to pull the plug and wait a few seconds.  According to Open Hardware Monitor, all the temperatures on the board are fine. (There doesn't seem to be a power supply sensor).

The power supply should be enough to handle the load according to [https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator](https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator) anyway.  It's a 600W supply, but it's quite old.  Probably purchased in late 2011.  The fan seems to be running fine though, and it isn't noticeably hot.

So I'm guessing power supply issue?  Anyone have other ideas?

It starts with 3 long beeps and 1 beep but then does 3 long beeps and 2 short beeps the next 5 times. I researched this and it says it is a memory problem but my RAM works perfectly fine. I then plugged my old ram in which I knew worked and it kept doing it. I also looked online and people said to keep one stick in and it’ll work but it didnt do anything. If anyone can diagnose whats wrong that will be a huge help!

The way I can most easily replicate it is 1) using folding at home to get to full GPU load, 2) using firefox to do something like watch a youtube video, and 3) start Davinci Resolve, hitting the CPU. If I do all of that at once (typically by accident as it's an edge case) it will likely all go black and silent. I did also have it crash like this once in the middle of editing a video. I have NOT experienced any issues when not running Davinci Resolve.

NOTHING is overclocked (yet) and XMP is disabled (for the moment)

Is this possibly a driver issue, or is it a power issue? I thought a good 750W PSU would be plenty for the 3070, but this really feels like a PSU problem..... but that is surprising to me. Everything should be up to date within a few weeks as far as drivers. I would blame Davinci, but the crashing to off instead of just a software crash is confusing.

Limiting framerate in NVIDIAs Systempanel influences the frequency at which these spikes occure but not their duration (lower framerate -&gt; lower frequency), but lowering graphic settings does not seem to affect it.

I have a Corsiar H100iV2 Cooler and I can&amp;#39;t seem to get the iCUE Software to recognize it. It&amp;#39;s constantly on 100% pump and fan speed. Also, my CPU is running incredibly hot and I have no idea why. It&amp;#39;s current idle state is 210 degrees F. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cooler is flush to the CPU, and even the BIOS will not recognize the pump. I&amp;#39;m at witts end, and I have no idea what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Just recently built my pc with a Ryzen 7  3700x, RTX 2080 S, 16Gb  of ram, b550 Mobo, it’s a powerful computer you  get the idea. Running  at 1440p at 144hz on an LG 27GL850

However  I’ve noticed  I get these microstutters/ FPS lags across all my games, no matter if it’s a  game like COD, Squad, Rust or a less demanding game like rouge company  or some RTS titles. I will be playing at 100+fps and every few minutes my FPS drops down to 10-20fps and even single digits for 3-4 seconds. It's really starting to bother me because a pc like this should not be struggling.

Checked  my  Nvidia driver and I have the most recent, my temps are fine I monitor them with HWinfo, no overheating. My GPU dosesn't break 70 Degrees C even while gaming for hours. I have all Win10 updates so everything seems to be squared away. I went a good  period of time with no stutters but now all of a sudden its become an issue. Just annoying dropping from 100+ to 10-20fps for a few seconds in games. And  it's consistent too. What could be causing this issue all of a sudden?


SOLVED EDIT: So based on others who experienced the same issue it was found that I too had my background/wallpaper rotation set to “every minute”. The issue was that every time the wallpaper changed, I suffered a FPS lag. This was confirmed after a little test where the time interval between each FPS drop was about 60 seconds which lined up with the change in wallpapers. I changed my wallpaper rotation to once a day and now I am NOT experiencing consistent FPS drops. Thank you guys!!!

Is my GPU dying out on me?",t2_5tmhvewk,False,,0,False,Consistent FPS Stuttering on High end PC?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Solved'}]",r/pcgamingtechsupport,False,6,Solved,0,,,False,t3_k2u3wl,False,dark,0.84,,public,11,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Solved,False,11,,False,self,1606625872.0,,[],{},,True,,1606621198.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.pcgamingtechsupport,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just recently built my pc with a Ryzen 7  3700x, RTX 2080 S, 16Gb  of ram, b550 Mobo, it’s a powerful computer you  get the idea. Running  at 1440p at 144hz on an LG 27GL850&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However  I’ve noticed  I get these microstutters/ FPS lags across all my games, no matter if it’s a  game like COD, Squad, Rust or a less demanding game like rouge company  or some RTS titles. I will be playing at 100+fps and every few minutes my FPS drops down to 10-20fps and even single digits for 3-4 seconds. It&amp;#39;s really starting to bother me because a pc like this should not be struggling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checked  my  Nvidia driver and I have the most recent, my temps are fine I monitor them with HWinfo, no overheating. My GPU dosesn&amp;#39;t break 70 Degrees C even while gaming for hours. I have all Win10 updates so everything seems to be squared away. I went a good  period of time with no stutters but now all of a sudden its become an issue. Just annoying dropping from 100+ to 10-20fps for a few seconds in games. And  it&amp;#39;s consistent too. What could be causing this issue all of a sudden?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOLVED EDIT: So based on others who experienced the same issue it was found that I too had my background/wallpaper rotation set to “every minute”. The issue was that every time the wallpaper changed, I suffered a FPS lag. This was confirmed after a little test where the time interval between each FPS drop was about 60 seconds which lined up with the change in wallpapers. I changed my wallpaper rotation to once a day and now I am NOT experiencing consistent FPS drops. Thank you guys!!! &lt;/p&gt;

,pcgamingtechsupport,"I built my first pc about two months ago and there haven't really been any issues besides this one. It happened when I was using the painting software Krita, everything was normal but then my mouse moved incredibly slow and the music I was listening to sounded really choppy and glitchy. I shut down my computer but all the clicks were glitchy and slow. After that there weren't any problems but then a couple weeks after the same thing happened with Krita again, this time as everything was becoming really slow I checked the software Core Temp to see my CPU temps and it was about 70 C and going down, not too good but no where near high enough to throttle. Same thing happened, everything slowed down and was unresponsive with the sound becoming all choppy. I looked into it and other Krita users said to turn off OpenGL which would stop it from using the graphics card, after that there was no issues with Krita.

That was until now, another few weeks later. I was playing minecraft and had in a VC on discord. Same thing happened, my fps dropped, sound started messing up too, and things started to become slow or unresponsive. I reset my pc then turned it off. I opened it up, cleaned out the dust, unplugged and replugged my graphics card, unplugged the graphics card wire and replugged in into the power supply, checked the other wires to see if they were in tight enough and they were. Both my CPU and GPU temps are no where near high enough to throttle after it, not to mention minecraft didn't enough use enough GPU power to turn the fans on. 

I have no idea what this issue is, maybe a MOBO or power supply thing? Maybe just my monitor being faulty?

GPU EVGA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER (Part number: 08G-P4-3062-RX.)
RAM 2x8 Corsair Vengeance

So I was finally able to finish my build last week. I decided to test out my Oculus Rift S and was confused why it was not connecting through either of my display ports ( I use HDMI for my monitor so never checked my DPs when I first received the card) My first theory is that it was the shitty Oculus software / the headset itself. So I took my Rift S to a buddies place and it worked instantly.

After getting back to my place I then tried using display port for my monitor and found out that wasn't getting any signal at all. I've browsed these forums and came across multiple articles just like these but none of the ""fixes"" that are offered seem to help.

I am begging to think both display ports on the card are faulty/stopped working. I looked into VBIOS updates but there is no updated software for the card anywhere. I've also adjusted multiple power settings, re-seated the GPU itself and fully removed all software via DDU. I've contacted EVGA and have had no response.

I hate being the person to ask for help on this and add another article to these forums but I have been at this for two days and have found nothing that will help.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

EDIT 1: I bought this card from my good buddy after he upgraded to a 3090. It worked great for him and did not have any issues up until I put it in my computer.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hey,

I was trying to overclock my CPU (AMD Ryzen 5 1600) to it's boost clock of 3.6 GHz.

When I filled in the new clock I exited and saved. (MSI click bios 5)

When the pc restarted I decided to go to the task manager to see if it was running at 3.6 GHz it's boost clock. 

And i was surprised when I read it was running at 1.38 GHz. That's even far below it's base clock of 3.20 GHz.

So now I don't know what the problem is and i would really like to fix it so that I can run it at it's boost clock.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Before anything else, I reinstalled this pump back onto the original Asus X99 motherboard it came off and it functions properly on that motherboard. Pump failure is not my issue and I took the time to verify that the pump does in fact still work. I borrowed another Corsair H115i AIO from a friend, installed it and it also does not operate on the MSI mobo, but works properly on the ASUS X99 mobo.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I know this is a long post but I want to put up all the info I have to avoid suggestions I've already implemented. I appreciate any help offered as I've run out of ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a new build, and Windows is not yet installed. The system posts properly and I can enter BIOS. All case fans operate properly and as the CPU temps rise the case fans are all ramping up as they are supposed to. Only the AIO pump does not operate as it should.

&amp;#x200B;

The cooler is a Corsair H110i GTX. It's old, I know, but it looks good with the new parts and more importantly it still does a good job with no air bubble noise. I would prefer not to replace it if I can avoid it. The cost isn't my concern, rather the quality of newer AIOs I've looked at is much lower and they all look pretty awful, hence my decision to try to reuse this one.

&amp;#x200B;

The cooler has 4 leads. The USB lead I have plugged into JUSB1 header. The Sata power lead is plugged into the PSU through a SATA power cable. The fan lead splits to run the radiator's two 140mm fans. The single wire ending in a 3-pin plug is connected to the CPU\_Fan\_1 header.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the same way I installed it on my previous X99 mobo. But my results are not the same on the MSI motherboard and I can't seem to figure out why.

&amp;#x200B;

* The Corsair logo illuminates properly. 
* The radiator fans both activate properly.
* The pump does not activate.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately without the pump I have a limited time to fart around in the MSI bios which I am very unfamiliar with. I'd also prefer not not run the CPU at 100C while fumbling around. Of course since there is a ticking clock as soon as I turn on the PC my IQ is reduced by half and I lose my ability to control a mouse because reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

What I have already managed to try based on local suggestions:

* Connect a regular fan to CPU\_Fan\_1 to see if a fan runs off that header. Fan operates properly, header is not faulty.
* Connect the AIO pump 3-pin lead to the PUMP\_FAN1 header. No change, PUMP\_FAN1 header will also operate a fan properly and is not faulty.
* Connect the AIO pump 3-pin lead to a SYS\_FAN lead. No change.
* Connect the AIO pump 3-pin lead to the PSU directly using a molex to 3-pin adapter. No change, using voltage tester direct power from the Molex plug is not 12V. I believe the pump needs a 12V signal. 
* In BIOS switch fan from PWM to DC. I have done this but unlike the BIOS in my previous PC there is no ""apply"" button so I'm not sure the changes I'm making are even taking effect.
* Allow the CPU to reach higher temps to see if the pump kicks in at higher temps - Eventually I get a message that the CPU is overheating and the PC shuts down. I would prefer not to have that happen again and would prefer not to even attempt another similar strategy.
* In BIOS switch the voltage manually to 12V. I've entered BIOS several times and as I am unfamiliar with the MSI BIOS have not found how/where to do this. The CPU temps start climbing over 90C and I have to shut down.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on about 6 hours of reading last night, I'm thinking the AIO waterpump needs a 12V signal to activate and is not getting a full 12V signal. The waterpump should be running 100% at all times unlike the fans and requires a simple 12V signal to activate. The mobo does not support my ancient AIO because it doesn't use the current standard AIO  hookup. As the signal cable connected to CPU\_FAN\_1 is a single one direction signal wire , the mobo is not detecting power draw from CPU\_Fan\_1 and therefore is not sending a signal to the pump to fire up.

&amp;#x200B;

If there is not way to do this through BIOS is there something I can wire up to send a 12V signal to the pump whenever the system is on so that it comes on regardless of what the motherboard is up to?

&lt;p&gt;If there is not way to do this through BIOS is there something I can wire up to send a 12V signal to the pump whenever the system is on so that it comes on regardless of what the motherboard is up to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again. thanks in advance to anyone that might have any suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

,pcgamingtechsupport,"I recently got an ASUS VG27AQ monitor, and have been having a strange issue with HDR. 

I'll start playing a game with HDR enabled, and everything is fine and looking great.

I can disable HDR and the problem will go away in SDR, but would like to keep playing with HDR enabled. 

Restarting the game does not seem to fix the issue, and it will stay this way across HDR enabled games. Restarting the PC seems to fix the issue temporarily, but it will happen again after playing for the same amount of time.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hello guys

Im experience some difficulties capturing gameplays with my PS5.

For to make use of my Astro A50’s 4th Gen i need a HDMI splitter from Elgato. Since the PS5 has no optical input.

I hooked everything up, set the video settings in my ps5 to 1080p. 

Opened the 4k program from elgato, nothing wrong
But when i check the display information on my LG 27GN950 (information on the screen it self) it shows 1080p 60hz

This doesn’t happen when i dont connect the 4k60pro.
The. It shows its 120hz at 1080p

Everything is hooked as it should. 

Hdmi goes from my ps5 to hdmi IN on the splitter, hdmi out from the splitter goes to the elgato IN, hdmi cable goes from elgato OUT to my monitor.

Without using the elgato, the display information shows 1080p 120hz

Sometimes i play 4k games on my ps5 at 60hz and that works smooth without issues, capturing works greats.

Is this problem on my side or does the 4k60 pro doesn’t support 120hz? On the website it can handle 1080p 240hz , 1440p 144hz and 4k on 60hz

Hey all,

So I noticed this issue a few days ago and can’t seem to figure it out. When playing on my PC there seems to be this issue where there is this very faint stuttering randomly. It’s most noticeable in Destiny 2 when looks around. It’s very faint and frame rate doesn’t drop when it happens. I’m also scoring very low on user benchmark. 16 to 18 percent in graphics. I have tried running games as admin. Turning windows game recording off. Used DDU to uninstall all drivers and reinstall. I’ve tried messing with just about every game setting. My GPU isn’t overheating at all according to MSI afterburner. I’ve ran Kombuster and it holds up fine. Any ideas of what to do?

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi everyone!

I know there have been plenty of posts on this general topic, but even through doing my due diligence I feel like I can't get a clear answer given my particular rig and scenario. 

Basically, please with some basic logic behind it, help me understand if and how high I need to be capping my FPS and why that will benefit me. 


**Relevant Parts of My Setup:**

Intel Core i7-10700 

MSI Z490 Motherboard

2080 Super 8 GB 

Dell S2719DGF 27.0"" 1440p, 144hz, freesync NOT gsync Monitor

**My current conclusion:** 

Since I have a 144hz freesync monitor, and a 2080 super + high end CPU, I should be able to push 144 fine in most competitive fps with settings on low. My main goal is max &amp; most *consistent* framerate. So, I use NVIDIA control panel to hard cap my output at 143fps. I leave framerate in-game uncapped if possible, or as high as custom will go. V-sync off, freesync on. This should allow the game to pump as many frames as possible while hard capping ensures my monitor stays at just below the max refresh rate for most conistency in framerate. 

However, I'm not sure that capping my fps seems to have made things FEEL smoother. But I do feel like I notice less drops? I'm just unsure and that's why I want an actual concrete understanding.

Should I cap it in some games and not others? If I can or cannot push 144? For instance, I have no problem pushing 144 in most games, if not well over that. Like valorant, rocket league, other well optimised games etc. But I can get 144 MAYBE on a good day with drops to lower hundreds in Apex and Warzone.

(regular reboot option from windows works fine) but Certain reboot request don't actually reboot: when asking to reboot into uefi from windows troubleshooter option and when asking to reboot from AMD chipset installer. 

The PC doesnt Turn off completely (still see gpu rgb lights), but it doesn't reboot either and fan case rgbs never turn on and windows never loads. I have to force power off then turn on and everything works normal.

Other symptoms are that mobo data sometimes shows in HWmonitor and sometimes it doesnt (this didnt happen before, i used HW monitor constantly for like a month cause i got a new cpu and gpu)

Also, gigabyte's SIV brought up random alerts of fans under 100rpm, when i actually could see the fans still working.,

Hello,

as you can see in the picture my GPU is on full load after undervolting, is this normal?

if there is no real downside to it i can just ignore it, cause it stays at 40°

For the context, I bought a new laptop right before the lockdown got announced, so I didn’t use it that much for the last 6 months (it has 16 days worked in total). 

The problem is that sometimes some artifacts appear on the screen for a fraction af a second.
Tbh there were more frequent artifacts on the screen before checking all the right drivers. However, even now I get some small artifacts.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi guys, since yesterday i have a strange problem with my gpu fans. While i was gaming, my rx 480 fans started pumping at max speed for extended periods of time. I checked gpu temps and they never went above 68 ° C. The fans spun even after closing the game, with my gpu hovering around 40°C. Only after like 2 minutes they went quiet again. What's worse is that now my fans start spinning at max speed as soon as i boot the pc and they don't stop. I hope that my fan controller didn't blow up or something. 

Of course, i have no kind of overclocking going on, both my cpu and gpu are at stock speeds. The problem was there both with manual fan control from radeon app and default settings applied. Also another thing to note is that right now Radeon app doesn't show my gpu fans rpm. It says that they are stuck at 0 rpm which is of course not true at all since they are going at full speed. I don't use msi afterburner, the only external monitoring programm that i have is hwmonitor, which i unistalled to see if it was affecting something. A thing to note is that hwmonitor didn't show my gpu fan speed (something that always did normally) which adds to the Radeon app showing me the 0 rpm thing.

My specs:

MSI H97 Gaming 3 Motherboard

I5 4590 (stock fan)

Sapphire rx 480

Evga 600w white

Crucial 500gb ssd

Seagate 1tb hdd

Windows 10 Operating System

P.S. I shut down my pc and waited like 5 minutes, booted up, fans started blowing again but when i arrived on windows screen, they went quiet.

While i was gaming, my rx 480 fans started pumping at max speed for extended periods of time. I checked gpu temps and they never went above 68 ° C. The fans spun even after closing the game, with my gpu hovering around 40°C. Only after like 2 minutes they went quiet again. What&amp;#39;s worse is that now my fans start spinning at max speed as soon as i boot the pc and they don&amp;#39;t stop. I hope that my fan controller didn&amp;#39;t blow up or something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, i have no kind of overclocking going on, both my cpu and gpu are at stock speeds. The problem was there both with manual fan control from radeon app and default settings applied. Also another thing to note is that right now Radeon app doesn&amp;#39;t show my gpu fans rpm. It says that they are stuck at 0 rpm which is of course not true at all since they are going at full speed. I don&amp;#39;t use msi afterburner, the only external monitoring programm that i have is hwmonitor, which i unistalled to see if it was affecting something. A thing to note is that hwmonitor didn&amp;#39;t show my gpu fan speed (something that always did normally) which adds to the Radeon app showing me the 0 rpm thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My specs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MSI H97 Gaming 3 Motherboard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I5 4590 (stock fan)&lt;/p&gt;

As described - my 5700xt when launching shadow of the tomb raider , locks up the system and reboots. I have :

.the latest chipset drivers and GPU drivers , I even rolled back to older drivers . (All using ddu)

.undervolted the card and fiddled with the power limit 

. Reinstalled windows twice. 

.Checked psu cables - fyi it's a 750w evga supernova PSU - so I doubt its a power delivery issue on that end.

.Switched cards bios.

Here's my situation.I got an old television of my brother and I want to use it for videos only. I can only use HDMI on that television. I'm using an Gtx 980 which happens to only have 1x mini HDMI and 4x mini Displayport. I don't have an adapter to convert it into normal HDMI, but to normal Displayport, which doesn't seem to help.

I know I just could buy a mini HDMI adapter, so don't be like: ""Just buy an Adapter"". I'll do so  if there's no possibility.

I found an old GPU(Gt 720 I believe?), which is way worse, maybe even worse than my iGPU, but it has HDMI. I know that I can just plug it into my Computer and it would work just fine. However I'm worried that it will affect my performance somehow as I'm running two GPUs, which are not even close to compareable. Is that so? Can I set it up, that my MainGPU processes everything? Any other solutions for this without buying extra gear?

Motherboard: MSI MPG x570 GAMING EDGE WIFI

CPU: Ryzen 9 3900x

GPU: MSI RTX 2070 GAMING Z

RAM: 64gb 3200MHz Vengeance RGB Pro

Display: Acer Predator XB273K (4k @ 144hz)

Storage: All SSD, 2 SanDisk Ultras + M.2 for Windows Install

\-

My issue is that whenever I try to launch an application-usually a game-I experience some sort of issue, with varying problems. Some examples:

Launching Overwatch will cause my computer to constantly dip to 10-20fps and stutter for about 5 minutes, then afterwards my computer plays the game like normal. My color settings in NVIDIA control panel also are automatically changed every time.

Launching Borderlands 3 will give some minor stutters and dips in FPS, however when tabbing into Epic Games, my computer can sometimes become unresponsive for a few seconds at a time. Will act normally when tabbed back into the game.

\-

I feel like I have exhausted just about all of my options. I have tried running games at different resolutions, changing the resolution in Windows, turning HDR on and off, uninstalling and reinstalling the games that had given me issue, running hardware scans, yet nothing really seems to make any noticeable difference in performance. My only other thought is that it's maybe some sort of bottleneck? I know the 2070 isn't really meant for 4k gaming, and aside from some smaller, less demanding titles, I'm still setting my games at 1080p or 1440p. The other thing that has me completely confused is that there's a lot of titles or applications that have no issues whatsoever, even when ran in 4k HDR, which makes me think that it's not a hardware issue. But I could be wrong.

I've just been extremely frustrated, as I've put a lot of money into this rig, only for it to barely work at times, even though it's got some quality parts in there. And while I mentioned my suspicion of it possibly being a bottleneck, I don't want to shell out over a grand on an Ampere card, only for that to not be the issue and still be in the same situation that I'm in now. So if anybody has any ideas as to what my issue would be, I would greatly appreciate it.

The F11i version.

after that i started building and now when i press the power button, it turns on but there is no screen.

I tried to reset CMOS but it did not help. Anyone please help.

Also when i try to longpress the power button to shut the pc down, nothing happens. the power button just blinks

Maybe CPU dead? It accidentaly came out when i tried to take out my cpu cooler but could that have been the reason to break it? the pins look good so i dont think thats the reason.

what can i do?

So I feel like I'm going insane rn. For some reason, no matter what I do, LA Noire doesn't seem to fully register that I'm using a controller. I have a PS4 controller and every other game seems to register it just fine, by register I mean Steam automatically translates the PS4 controller inputs as Xbox 360 controller inputs. But for some reason when I try playing LA Noire, it seems to only register it as a controller if I'm moving the left analog stick up and down, but when I press any button the icons quickly switch back to keyboard icons as if I'm using a mouse and keyboard and what I'm pressing does nothing.

This is so frustrating because literally yesterday it didn't have this problem and worked perfectly, but it had another issue so I had to reinstall the game on my steam. Now that I've reinstalled it the other issue is gone but now I have this controller issue.

I've tried DS4, X360CE, hell even Joy2key does nothing.

This is *significantly* longer than the load speeds it's had in the past.

I assume this is an issue with my video card, which I haven't upgraded in some years, but I figured I'd ask y'all if this is obviously some other issue that I'm just not thinking of or if there is some easy diagnosis method to verify if the card is functioning normally.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Ok, i'll get straight to the point, that being, i need a GPU upgrade, it's pretty bad, with me having a GTX 960 OC from 6 years ago, and i was planning on upgrading this Christmas (I am looking for an NVIDIA GPU and not AMD, because i want the sweet DLSS, Ray Tracing and to be compatible to my G-SYNC monitor). My budget is around 620$ MAX. When i heard the news abut the RTX 3070 back a month ago, i thought of it as a no brainer, 500$ for an RTX 2080Ti is pretty good, but the situation is pretty bad right now, the lowest priced 3070 in stock being around 900$, which makes me quite sad tbh because it's just straight up bullshit, hyping everyone up for the 3000 series and then making bicycles instead of GPUS.

Long story short - is it worth getting something now, like a 2070 (normal 2080s are in stock, but are 1100$ in my country KEKW)  or waiting... i estimate around 4 months for prices to cool, and get a 3070?

Any other GPU suggestions are welcome! Oh and one more thing, if i have the latest NVIDIA game drivers installed, will i need to install additional drivers if i change my GPU? Thanks!

The PC never fully restarted and the screen never came back on (no post, no ROG logo, no Windows logo) although the RGB is going as usual along with fans spinning. The board is getting power but something is up with the CPU initializing thus preventing a full startup. 

I've slowing started taking it apart. All USB unplugged, then all HD's except m.2's, GPU then all but one stick of ram.

I checked all the parts before buying especially the hdd which had 100% health and performance. Even after coming home i ran crystal disk info which told me the hdd was in good condition and hd sentinal told me it was on for about 120hrs and had 1000 days life remaining. I did started getting bsod with the error"" unexpected store exception error"". Once it happened while playing rdr2 and twice when watching YouTube vids. I changed sata cable and port when bsod occurred and system was saying no hdd when booting. From yesterday i could hear random  krrr sound coming from my Pc. I thought it must be some coil whine sound and so didn't paid much attention to it. When playing fortnite, the game froze but i could hear and talk to my friends. Then i again got bsod with the error kernel data inpage error. So to troubleshoot i ran mem test which reported zero errors.  I then again checked with hdd sentinel which stated 100% and 100% performance with no bad sectors and crystal disk info which also reported all was good and hdd temp when idle was 20 degree and about 30-35 when doing tasks. At last before giving up i went to the properties of my C drive, tools,error checking tool and started it up which froze my pc and gave ""unexpected store exception error"". I restarted my Pc and now could hear constant krrr sound from my hdd. My pc now fails to recognize hdd and doesn't boot up. I have an old 80gb hdd which is easily recognized by my Pc. I have tried changing hdd psu cable but the krrr sound can still be heard. 
I have googled and have not found any issues like mine. Those hdd that fail produce clicking sound while mine is producing a different sound and most important of all is that crystal disk info and hdd sentinel were not reporting any bad sectors or problem.
My Question is that is crystal disk info and hdd sentinel not accurate? If yes then does that means you should always buy a new hdd?

,pcgamingtechsupport,"PlayStation App Audio Mixing

Goodmorning all!

So this is a weird concept and who knows, it might not even be possible, but here it goes. 

With the release of the newest call of duty, I’ve switched over to PC for this one. The group I play with is still on PS4/5, which leaves us the communication barrier. Now, we don’t like using game chat AT ALL, so we’ve resorted to me joining the voice chats on my phone (PS App) and running smaller headphones under my PC Gaming ones. I’m looking for a way to ONLY use on headset for both the output of the PC game, output of the PS App voice chat, AND the input to the PS App voice chat.

I’ve thought of a few ways this could be done but I have zero knowledge in these fields. Bare with me as I try to explain what I envision here.

What I’m picturing would be splitting the iPhone PS App audio to headphone and mic with a splitter. Taking the headphone portion and either a) feeding it into the pc as an input device and having “listen to device” on so I can always here it or b) purchasing an Audio Mixer with a 3.5mm jack. Using the audio mixer, I’d feed in the PS App output along with the PC game output which would end up running into my headphones (my headphones are already split for headphone/mic at the end) then simply plugging my headphone mic to the iPhone input.

If anyone has any knowledge in this field, has done something like this before, or could tell me I’m crazy, feel free! I’m just tired of using iPhone headphones under my over the ear headphones just to talk to people since the PS App isn’t available on PC.

I have had problems since I got this laptop about 4-5 months ago. There are 2 main problems, but the only one I care about today is the FPS. 

In multiple games, including Far Cry New Dawn, Sunautica, Sea of Thieves, and more, my FPS has very noticeable peaks and valleys. In other games, like Far Cry Blood Dragon, Assassins Creed Origins, and Apex Legends, my FPS is just unplayably low (around 20 fps at the lowest settings, but around 40 in Apex; apex is not unplayable, I actually play it often, its just very annoying) In the first games mentioned, for a couple of seconds, I will get insanely smooth FPS, then it will dip to a disgusting stutter for about the same amount of time, before it goes back up, then down again, and so on. My Nvidia FPS overlay has not worked for a couple of months now, but from what I remember Far Cry New Dawn will bounce from 80ish fps down to 20ish. In that game specifically, changing graphics settings to the minimum will make it go from 90 to 25 FPS instead, but the peaks and valleys did not go away. Turing off Game Bar background recording changed nothing, and turning off windows game mode DID eliminate the peaks and valleys in Subnautica, but the game just consistently stayed at the lowest FPS. I used to think this was a GPU issue, because when I took it to a computer repair shop to fix the issues I will talk about in the next paragraph, they said there could be a faulty GPU in the system. Later, I began to think it was a RAM problem, so I upgraded to 16GB, which did slightly increase FPS in Apex, but it didn't seem to do much more.

The other problem, which I have learned to accept, and I am only listing in case it is relevant to the other issue, is with the Microsoft store. (keep in mind that all of the issues above were happening while this was happening, I just had very few games installed at this time and I cared more about this) The problem is that games will open once or twice, then never again. Even after reinstalls, the game would simply just never open again. It has been a long time, but I remember the file shortcut icons on my desktop disappearing as well. In an attempt to fix this, Microsoft support gave me a specific unlisted windows update to install, this did not fix the issue. Later I would find out this very stupid Microsoft employee gave me an update that was incompatible with my system, with caused a HOST of other issues, including the start menu not opening, and the search bar not working. I could only open apps through file manager. I took my laptop to a computer repair shop to fix the issues with the start menu, as I was not aware that the update wasn't compatible. I told them about the Microsoft store issues as well, and when I came back to get my laptop, they told me about the update, and that they think the Microsoft store problem has something to do with a faulty GPU. I told Dell support, as hardware issues are covered under their warranty, and they did a test that took only about 5 minutes, told me my hardware was fine, and that I would need to pay $100 dollars to get their advanced software support. I did that, and they factory reset my laptop. The only thing the factory reset fixed was the start menu issues, and everything else persists today. (Quick side note about the GPU issues, for a couple of days \[about a week before the factory reset\], I got random errors that said something about my GPU being incompatible, then they went away, and I have not gotten such an error since.) These events took place 4ish months ago. 

One more note about the games with low FPS. My laptop has an Nvidia 1660ti Mobile. My friend (with whom I play PC games wth very often) has a laptop with around the same specs as me, except he has an RTX 2060 mobile. His GPU SHOULD be only marginally better, (20ish percent) except his laptop has none of the issues I have, and he is getting around 100 FPS in Apex on high settings. He is also getting consistently high FPS in Subnautica, but I don't know his specific FPS in that game.

And ONE more quick thing. All GPU benchmarks I have done match up exactly how they should between me and my friend, his being slightly better than mine. But he isn't having the issues I am.

Thank you with my ENTIRE heart for anyone who even attempts to help me with this. It's so bad I am pretty sure I might make the switch back to console.",t2_2n70cdm7,False,,0,False,"Extensive problems with FPS, games not opening","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Performance issue'}]",r/pcgamingtechsupport,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_k1s4z9,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Performance issue,False,3,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1606470990.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.pcgamingtechsupport,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a Dell G5 5590 Laptop; no longer sold; RAM upgraded to 16 GB from 8 GB&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Updated the wireless adapter driver, uninstalled and reinstalled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this and the problem still exist. Never did downloaded a program that may cause the problem.  When there are times that it reconnected, it is either slow or no internet at all. The Ethernet using LAN cable works fine tho, but I really need to be connected wireless due to my room and setup&amp;#39;s location from the router.&lt;/p&gt;

My Specs are; shown in DxDiag [System Tab](https://imgur.com/yMv4Fy9) [Display Tab](https://imgur.com/XqWTs7x)

GPU: NVIDIA 1060 GTX 3 GB

CPU: Intel I5 6600k 3.5 GHz quad core

-----------------------
I had bought a SSD and two sticks of RAM to help boost my PC a bit and   get faster load times.

SSD: SanDisk Ultra 3D SSD 2TB

RAM: HyperX FURY (2 x 8 GB) 2666MHz DDR4 (the same  type as already in my PC so its now 4 of the same make, size and MHz)

-----------

I copied over a 1 TB HDD image to my new SSD so I had all my stuff still, that all worked and  the partitions are all fine (I followed a tutorial)

I Then installed my RAM after I was sure my  new SSD worked as well, and had sorted out boot options so I can later add my old HHD for extra space if needed.

This is were the real issues began for me, and I can't seem to shift them despite all the advice I have  found.

-----------

**The Issues**

i have  a few issues. 

firstly, my pc sometimes  starts covered in horizontal white lines, i will link a picture  below of a good representation. [White Lines](https://i.imgur.com/J9QBA11.jpg)

Secondly when it doesnt  have  the white lines after restarting a couple of times, in device manager my GPU always   has an warning [symbol](https://imgur.com/XVOBq1q)

on clicking on  that warning symbol I am told I have an error code,  [Code 43](https://imgur.com/RRCeEg3).
I cannot seem to fix this despite uninstalling, reinstalling driver, updating it, troubleshoot does nothing for me and there is no roll-back option. i have also followed common fix videos for it.

Thinking my issue may have been physically the GPU I unplugged and  dusted the card before plugging it back in making sure all cables are attached firmly in case adding the RAM I had knocked it loose.

Lastly I had been playing PC games before and after the RAM was installed to check out the new speed differences and it all seemed fine for a  day or so before the next day I   went to boot  a  game and was offered this error as well. [DX11 feature level 10.0](https://imgur.com/fl8QvLc) which I had no idea about, it may have been their before but i  doubt it as the games i had tested before, while still running, can not launch properly and lag even on menus where as before it didn't have an issue.

I assume its my PC not using my GPU and using the onboard available.

I've been having this problem for 3 days now. I've tried almost everything to solve it but doesn't seem to work.

Things that I've tried

Resetting my pc  
Clean install of drivers  
Using UDD to uninstall the drivers and then downloading them with no internet.  
Cleaning my graphics card  
Using a different motherboard  
Different versions of windows  
Different versions of NVIDIA drivers Standard and DCH drivers

I don't think is a hardware problem since the card performs fine under a stress test but who knows it could still be the card.

Problem in more detail: When I install the drivers it just gives me a black screen at by the beginning of the installation, I've tried disconnecting the monitor and plugging it back it but it doesn't seem to work and I've also tried to use different display port cables. After that I have to force shutdown my computer, then try to boot into windows again but now it gives me a black screen at boot. Then I have to go into safe mode and uninstall all graphics drivers in order to boot into windows.

Every 3 or 4 times the system is turned on, everything boots up as expected except the red debug light for the boot drive on my motherboard stays on. Whenever this happens, I can't write to my drive at higher than 10KB/s making it impossible to download anything. A system restart will fix this issue for a few days but it'll always return. 

Multiple times, the GPU light has also been lit even though that seems to be operating just fine.

I've tried changing different BIOS settings and checking connections but the problem still persists and it's driving me mad! If you have any thoughts on how I could I could fix this I'd be extremely grateful for some help.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi guys, I've noticed that my game's video suddenly freeze for 1 to 3 seconds when playing. It's kinda annoying, specially on competitive games like CS:GO and I feel there's no reason this should go on. Any ideas on what it would be? (Happens on PAYDAY 2 too). Let's say I'm playing for around 3 minutes and then freezes on a single frame for 3 seconds and keeps on running. The GPU when limited could run at 50% and still freeze. The CPU never goes above 40% usage. so I know it's not a thermal throttling issue. I am thinking it could be a hardware problem with the graphics card but idk.

&amp;#x200B;

CPU: Ryzen 5 5600x

Ram: Trident Z Neo 3600Mhz 16gb \[XMP Enabled\]

SSD and 3xHDD (Happens on games installed on either drives)

GPU: Gigabyte GTX 970 4gb (Yeah, I need an upgrade probably)

PSU: Corsair CX600M

Cooling: CoolerMaster Masterliquid ML240

Motherboard: Aorus B550 Elite ATX mobo

Drivers: Latest Nvidia Drivers (456.71) \[Edit: Updated to latest\]

Monitors: Triple Lenovo 1080p Monitors at 75Hz

&amp;#x200B;

This is also a fresh install of Win10 x64 professional

Sound can still be heard during the freezing

Edit: Just happens on the monitor playing games, I can have a 60fps video running flawlessly on my other monitor

Edit2: Just swapped PSU and Graphics card (One at a time) for another 500W thermaltake PSU and a GTX 780 and the problem persisted.

Edit3: Updated video drivers to latest ones, verified game integrity, moved game to SSD,  disconnected ethernet and tested on safehouse. Problem persists. Things I've noticed: HWmonitor indicates power drop both on 780 and 970 with either PSU when problem occurs and GPU usage drops to 0%. I also did a full BurnInTest with both DirectX 9 and 12 and there were no issues :S it's killing me.

&lt;p&gt;I had tried clearing the cmos before as I read that online, tried taking everything apart and putting it back again, reseating cpu, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wondering if there’s anything obvious I’m missing, or if I should start a return process with amazon to try for another motherboard as I see this issue is somewhat common online with this motherboard I have&lt;/p&gt;

The thing is, at full volume of everything (the litter slider on the side of the headset, my volume mixer, sound settings &gt; master volume, call of duty settings volume... Everything is on 100. It's not SO quiet that I can't hear anything, but I prefer gaming loud, but even for regular standards and someone who doesn't want explosions to break their ears, it's still kind of quiet, meh at best. Some people online were saying things like ""you just have a cheap headset"", so I go and buy an Astro A40, and same problem  


So now I know, it's gotta be something about the pc. I'm thinking I might be missing some drivers? I have the realtek audio drivers that you install with the mobo, is there anything else I need? My case is the Silverstone FARA R1, could this case be the problem somehow? Could it be a loose connection to be mobo?

I've tried, 

1.taking out cmos

2.taking out all USB connections

3.taking out all ssds/boot drives

4.plugging HDMI into motherboard (unfortunately 
disabled integrated graphics beforehand)

5.booting completely with no cmos battery

&lt;p&gt;3.taking out all ssds/boot drives&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.plugging HDMI into motherboard (unfortunately

As we talked and I was trying to convince him of why he should take a run at PC gaming he was under the impression that every time you play a game on a PC before you could play it that you would need to optimize it. 

I explained this could be true in some instances and I went on to explain why.  He then asked me if there were preset settings.  And I answered almost in every game that I have seen there are preset settings. 

His follow up question to me was this
“So if he was playing Avengers on the PC what would the PRESET setting be that would closely resemble Xbox series X or a PS5. “

,pcgamingtechsupport,"There are a few layers to this so please bear with me. I got parts to build my first brand new pc today- Ryzen 5 5600x, ASUS ROG Strix x570 (with a bios update), 2x8gb of HyperX 3200mhz ram, XPG 256gb m.2 nvme ssd and a 750w seasonic strider gold certified psu (with a couple of other parts In reusing). I put everything together watching build tutorials online and thoroughly reading the manuals that came with the parts and everything more or less went smoothly, but when I went to turn on the power button nothing happened. (Yes the psu was switched on) 

None of the 3 fans spin, no lights light up on the case. The motherboard’s rog logo lit up but nothing else showed signs of life. On top of that there is a solid red light that shows up on the top left of the mobo, but of the other lights indicate component errors.

I have now unplugged everything and reseated the front IO panel (making sure the positive and negative pins were connected properly), as well as the ram and one EPS 4+4 pin connector and the 20 pin connector for the motherboard and nothing has changed. I’m not sure if the psu was dead on arrival or if my ram is faulty or any other 3rd scenario (I also tried powering on with only one of the two ram sticks installed twice and nothing happened). 

So where do I go from here? I’m not sure how to test the psu for any faults and I don’t have any spare compatible parts to swap out. Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you. [photos for reference ](https://imgur.com/gallery/oFD4F6N)

,pcgamingtechsupport,Hi guys. I bought my first custom built PC in 2018 and so far I have sent it back twice for the same issue. I'll have the PC running and it doesn't matter if it is in a game or just on the desktop. It'll lose power and boot back on randomly. Both times I have sent it down it hadn't showed this fault. So far it's been moved to another case and had the ram replaced. The PC worked fine for a few months before the error returned. Just wondering if anyone had had anything similar happen before I have tried removing the graphics card and all other input like keyboards Incase they might be the issue. I have even tried different power outlets. Sometimes it'll shut off in less than 5 mins.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"First the problem. I have had more than my fair share of problems with Fallout 4, modding it has obviously caused a series of performance issues. But every time I've f'd it up, I've managed to figure out the problem and fix it. Quite recently the performance issues have seemed to get worse, namely lag and occasional freezes. I initially thought this had to be mod nonsense, but now I'm not sure. I've been playing Dying Light on the side with zero issues aside from the occasional mini-freeze/lag. But now it also seems to have very bad lag. The lag is most prevalent the more action is going on, so I suspect hardware.

Second. The irritating benchmark: [https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/35926260](https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/35926260)Irritating because I have a gaming laptop (Acer Nitro AN515-43) with two GPU's. Despite setting it in windows power settings it won't test my discrete GPU (Radeon RX 560X), only the onboard GPU. When running the test it says: WARN: skipping Radeon RX 560X Series - unable to locate attached display.

Last considerations. Fo4 is installed on my SSD, and DL on my HDD. It's possible there are separate issues affecting both of them. But I'm sure it's not a coincidence that they both started to have the same problem at the same time. However, F04's lag is much worse despite being on much lower settings and userbench says that my HDD is underperforming. Overall though my settings don't seem to affect the performance, I have the same issue on both games regardless of settings. I also bought a cooling pad, in case the issue was throttling of some kind, but that's made no difference either.

I would like to add images of potentially useful information from afterburner, nitrosense and novabench. But it seems I cannot in this sub, but I have them ready if the info will help.

I have always struggled with RGB in my build. I have an ASROCK motherboard which features ASROCK Polychrome Sync, and I have Team T-Force Delta RGB DDR4 RAM which advertises compatibility with ASROCK Polychrome Sync. Even if it doesn't I have gotten it to work in the past. Now, all of a sudden, it refuses to be detected. I assume it is still being detected by the computer because if not I would not have RAM. I even went as far as to look for an RGB software specific to Team T-Force (Blitz) but it was discontinued in April 2020. I found the last supported version, installed it, and when I opened it it was unable to find any DDR4 ram installed or something like that.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"I had a 144 hz gaming monitor, and recently I just switched to another one with 170hz and hdr support.

My Equipment: GTX 1080 Ti, i7 6700K. Both monitors are connected through DP 1.4.

The issue is: the screen will turns black for a second, whenever I open Xbox Game Bar overlay, or switch back to desktop, even when the game setting has the same resolution and refresh rate in both desktop and game.

I had this issue already with my previous gaming monitor, and turns out that even FreeSync is turned off in Nvidia Setting, once the FreeSync feature is enabled in monitor OSD Setting, this issue will happen. It was solved by turning the FreeSync off in monitor OSD.

But now it happens again with my new monitor. I have FreeSync or AdaptiveSync off in both monitor and Nvidia setting. I have HDR turned on in both monitor and windows setting, and in nvidia setting it uses ""let application decide"". This issue becomes extremely annoying while playing Forza Horizon 4. Whenever an achievement was unlocked, it went black for 3 seconds, then goes back. Also when the notification disappeared, it went black again. Not to mention enable the game bar overlay in mid game.

This happens with my MPC-BE with madVR too. I successfully setup madVR with HDR, and it can finally playback HDR content (I failed to configure EVR with HDR), but it has same issue whenever the video goes into fullscreen and leave fullscreen. Also, whenever my mouse moves above the time slides and the slide shows up, my screen will turn black too.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"so I have a custom desktop that I built some years ago now, its worked great up until recently and I'm stumped. Started out with just some connection issues, and occasionally I'd have to troubleshoot the sound and itd come back. Well I figured I'd get a usb wifi thing since even when my internet worked it was slow and figured that the old pci-e card was having issues. Also moved my desk and set up to other side of the room at this point, cleaned out the pc and tried setting up the usb wifi. 

This is where everything went to shit. I have no wifi connections. no matter what I do I can't even connect or see wifi connections, I can't get sound to work at all ( I use a Scarlett focusrite and studio monitor speakers but even plugging headphones directly into the desktop doesn't show anything). can't find things that should be there. 

Also a thing keeps popping up about a firewall but clicking it to turn it on doesnt work. Nothing works right. But its weird because my mouse and keyboard do (wireless mouse, wired keyboard both have been moved to other usb ports and they work on all of em, but when I plug in focusrite and the wifi thing neither of those do anything)

When I put discs in the trey they also don't come up or do anything. 

So I began troubleshooting spent the past 3 days trying various things, but to be honest I think I fucked it all up worse, at some point I got frustrated and started just deleting stuff, only to realize I also can't system restore. its like things work but nothing works... Idk how to explain. I deleted drivers I think. Idk what I did but I made it worse.

Ill try attaching pictures but I'm assuming this thing is toast. Wondering how I can fix it or start over, do I try getting a new windows disc and doing a new install? How? can I go back to windows 7 since windows 10 is all problems? Is there something in bios that can maybe make my computer find my network card and find wifi signals? Why is the audio not working ? why are other things working in usb ports but not my audio or wifi? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, kind of just bummed because I put a lot of money into this thing some time back and have upgraded things over the years, Idk why these problems started. I tried uninstalling updates , feel like I've tried everything. thanks to whoever may help

* couple other things, only other things I did with it recently were put a Bluetooth usb thing for my ps4 controller to work and had no issues with that a few weeks back, oh and my hyper cooler 212 evo's fan died so I installed a new one onto it, that was a few days prior to all these increased issues

Started out with just some connection issues, and occasionally I&amp;#39;d have to troubleshoot the sound and itd come back. Well I figured I&amp;#39;d get a usb wifi thing since even when my internet worked it was slow and figured that the old pci-e card was having issues. Also moved my desk and set up to other side of the room at this point, cleaned out the pc and tried setting up the usb wifi. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where everything went to shit. I have no wifi connections. no matter what I do I can&amp;#39;t even connect or see wifi connections, I can&amp;#39;t get sound to work at all ( I use a Scarlett focusrite and studio monitor speakers but even plugging headphones directly into the desktop doesn&amp;#39;t show anything). can&amp;#39;t find things that should be there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also a thing keeps popping up about a firewall but clicking it to turn it on doesnt work. Nothing works right. But its weird because my mouse and keyboard do (wireless mouse, wired keyboard both have been moved to other usb ports and they work on all of em, but when I plug in focusrite and the wifi thing neither of those do anything)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I put discs in the trey they also don&amp;#39;t come up or do anything. &lt;/p&gt;

I'm moving from a 2000 series ryzen to a 3000 series XT cpu, and i was wondering about a few things:

1. for my MOBO there are quite a few bios updates, and from on a certain point, they are updates that enables the use of 3000 series CPU's. Would i then have to update until that point using the 2000 series and then switch the CPU as i move accross that version? 
2. do i need to do every single BIOS update or can I just install the BIOS that enables the 3000 series CPU and then install the newest one ? 

It would be great if anyone has any pointers / answers to these.

I currently have an NZXT H510 Case and a MSi B450 Tomahawak Max MOBO. My PC was working last night, until this morning (built the PC in June). I have already determined the power supply and electrical source is working (as my speaker and monitor hooked up to the same power bar work).

When I press on the front panel power button, MOBO lights or fans do not start up. Power source is running (Corsair RM750x) and has a current. Worst comes to worst, I'm probably gonna start off by purchasing a cheap PC case to see if it's the case's front panel's that's the culprit or another MOBO, after stripping the PC to the basics and trying from there.

However, I figured that someone knows a lot better than I do, and sought to ask for help or suggestions for things to try before making purchases I'd rather avoid.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hello everyone, pc noob here just needing some help!

So about 2 months ago I upgraded my gpu to a Gigabyte rx 5600xt, and ever since then my pc has issues when booting up. When I turn on my pc, the windows logo pops up for about 2 seconds, then the screen freezes then goes black. I end up having to hard reset my pc about 3 or 4 times before I can get it to boot up properly. Once the pc is running, I have no issues with it. After doing some research, I've heard that the AMD Adrenaline software is causing people some issues. I previously had an RX 590 in my pc but had no issues with it. I also recently upgraded my psu thinking it was an issue with my gpu not having enough power but nothing has changed. So my question is, is the issue my gpu, software, or hardware? Thanks in advance!

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi,

Just a few days ago I left my PC running an online game overnight. The game is nearly two decades old and has had no issues running on PCs many many years older than this one. But suddenly it started using 20-50% of my GPU usage in task manager sometime between Nov 21-22 with a single instance of the game running. When people with very similar specs are reporting 10% max usage with multiple instances of the game running. Up until the day this issue started I haven't changed anything graphically settings wise nor installed any new drivers. AFAIK no Windows updates had been performed in the time frame. I have monitored GPU function in EVGA precision a bit and noticed some times when I leave the game on overnight and turn back on my monitors the GPU and Memory clock MHz are both stuck at fixed numbers (not sure how much this matters) but even when they aren't I'm still getting the same issues in-game.

Current troubleshooting steps I've taken:

rebooted the game and PC

ran virus and malware scans that turned up nothing

uninstalled old drivers using DDU in safemode and reinstalled newest drivers.

Completely uninstalled the game and graphic mods within the game I had installed a full week prior without issue.

Made sure to disable Link State Power Management under Advanced Power Options &gt; PCI Express

Just installed a few other more modern games to test. Tested on Dark Souls 3 and getting 50% of GPU usage in task manager as well.

Main specs are:

Windows 10 64 bit

EVGA Nvidia RTX 2070 Super

AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12-core

MSI MAG X570 Tomahawk motherboard

Dual monitor lg 27gl850-b

&amp;#x200B;

Anything else I need to include here just let me know please. Racking my brain trying to figure out what the issue is.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"I posted this question in r/pcgaming but they told me to go here. If this is also the wrong place to ask, I'd appreciate a suggestion towards the correct subreddit.

So I'm pretty bad at m&amp;k fps gaming. It stems from having a tiny mousepad and not knowing how to calibrate my settings. For example, in playing *Black Ops: Cold War*, my biggest issues are:

* Lining up my ADS shot. If I see an enemy in the distance and I ADS my crosshair doesn't lock in precisely. Its always off by a few feet/inches. I can't tell if its because my settings are too sensitive or not sensitive enough. Most prevalent in long engagements but I also whiff in close quarters.
* Tracking moving targets. I flail when it comes to hitting a running target. I'm either tracking a little behind an enemy running or sporadically around the enemy.

I've included screenshots of my current mouse settings in BOCW. The mouse I'm using is **DeathAdder Elite** (I'd prefer to not have to buy another mouse but I'll listen to suggestions). I don't have space for a giant mousepad. My mouse settings going in is 800dpi. How can I best tune my settings/play well with a small mousepad?

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi Everyone, 

I'm looking for a little advice regarding hardware upgrades; my current setup is as follows:

Mainboard: ASUS ROG Maximus VI Extreme

CPU: Intel Core i7 4770k @ 3.5GHz

RAM: 16GB DDR3 

GPU: ROG STRIX GTX 970

I'm looking at investing in some new components, mainly the GPU, as I've never had issues with any of the other hardware, however, I'm aware my processor and mainboard are quite old, only being 4th gen quad core.

I've had my eye on an RTX2080Ti. 

Should I be looking at upgrading anything else first before I consider upgrading my GPU to something as recent as a 2080Ti?

When I look at system requirements for games, like the soon-to-be-released Cyberpunk 2077, I meet the recommended spec with the exception of GPU, and this tends to be the case with most games, i trend to use systemrequirementslab for checking compatibility with games.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",t2_8x82ljs,False,,0,False,Component Upgrade Advice,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Hardware'}]",r/pcgamingtechsupport,False,6,Hardware,0,,,False,t3_k04wq9,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Hardware,False,3,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1606253055.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.pcgamingtechsupport,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone, &lt;/p&gt;

,pcgamingtechsupport,"I've been troubleshooting my issue for over a week now, so I'll try and round up what I know so far. First of all, my components:

|Motherboard|Asus ROG MAXIMUS VIII HERO LGA 1151|
|:-|:-|
|PSU|EVGA SuperNOVA 850 G2 80+ GOLD|
|CPU|Intel i7-6700K CPU @ 4.00GHz|
|GPU|EVGA RTX 2060 Super|
|Mouse|Razer Deathadder v2 Pro (wireless)|
|Keyboard|Razer Blackwidow Chroma|
|Mic|Pop voice lavalier mic|
|OS|Windows 10 Home 64-Bit 20H2 19042.630|
|Realtek drivers|6.0.1.8158|
|Razer deathadder v2 pro drivers|10.0.15063.0|

**Configuration (relevant, I promise)**

* Razer Deathadder v2 Pro (wireless) is plugged into a usb 2.0 port with an extender that moves it away from the rest of the PC/Mobo and close to the mouse
* Mic is plugged into the Mobo's mic jack
* Blackwidow Chroma plugged into usb 2.0

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

* I recently installed the 2060 super, which allowed me to play demanding games again. Examples:
   * Witcher 3 on 1440p/ultra settings @ 100ish fps
   * CoD:Warzone at 1440p/low settings @ 110 ish fps

&amp;#x200B;

**Issue summary**

* I noticed that after booting up, my performance would degrade over time, in a weird way. Say 30 minutes after booting the PC up, as I move my mouse, I'll start to notice that it halts normal system behavior for 100ms. If I keep using the PC, the delays would get worse.
* I looked up mouse interference and many, many people have had the issue. Some have diagnosed it as a problem with Realtek drivers, but this is only half true. If you disable Realtek drivers, the problem will go away completely (great!) but then the mic port stops working and audio processing just goes to hell in demanding games, which causes its own lag.
* I updated Realtek drivers and Razer drivers (as well as all GPU/Windows updates I could find). This does not fix the problem.
* Next, I noticed that some people said the problem was caused by the Razer devices being plugged into USB 3.0 instead of USB 2.0 ports. Weird, but I gave it a shot and made sure the devices were plugged into USB 2.0 inputs only. I did this mid-game while the interference lag was occurring, and wow, it went away (great!). I thought the issue was fixed, but then after restarting, I noticed that the problem continued to occur.
* It seemed like the solution was actually unplugging the USB peripherals and then re-plugging them in. Weirdly, that is my best solution right now. I play these games until I start to notice any interference lag between mouse / system. When it happens, I unplug my mouse and keyboard and then plug them back in, and this fixes the issue for about 1 hour, until it comes back, and I repeat the unplug/replug.

&amp;#x200B;

So that's where I am right now. I have to unplug my devices and plug them back in once an hour to fix the issue. I am not an engineer, but this seems like, maybe:

* Does unplugging the USB devices shut down a system process that has hit a memory leak? Then when I replug them in, the memory leak begins again, but it takes a long time for it to reach problematic levels for my system?
* Does unplugging the USB devices normalize some kind of electrical charge that is disrupting my PSU, motherboard, or sound processes?

&amp;#x200B;

Brought a PC from cyberpower (i7-9700, 16gb RAM, 2070 super). Worked perfectly until I launched Call Of Duty. A really loud, wizzing/squealing sound was coming from what seemed like the GPU. It would stop as soon as I exited out of call of duty.

I contacted tech support, sent the PC back, and my 2070 was upgraded to the new 3070. PC tested, given the OK to be sent back to me.

It arrived today, set it up, downloaded COD, and the SAME noise is still happening when COD is open. Stop as soon as it closes. Now I think it could be the PSU. I'm going to contact tech again tomorrow, but if anyone has any idea what it could be, any help would be appreciated.

I've linked to 3 videos so anyone can have a listen.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"I was given a complete PC (MEDION Erazer i72000/B734) for Christmas in 2015. It was very, very loud sometimes doing a ticking sound. Then there was a popping sound and it was running quietly again. Eventually it startet being loud again. After this happened 3 times over the years, this year I opened the PC and investigated the issue. I found a cable hanging into the GPU cooler. Every time it popped, a single rotor blade had broken. The cable hull was a little bit cut. I tied the cable away with zip ties and the PC worked fine and was far more quiet.

Later this year the PC started restarting randomly. (Yes, I saw the tip to remove single parts and look if it works to find the reason) Sometimes it completely crashed while playing games, with the CPU being at 100%, sometimes it just restarted. Sometimes I could play a game without problems, ther times I couldn't. Sometimes CPU was at 100% at it stuttered, sometimes it just crashed or restarted. Occasionally the PC had problems booting after a restart or crash. One time I resetted the PC because it did not boot all the time, but it didn't fix the issue 

First I thought the new headset was the problem (HyperX Cloud II) but the error occurred with other headsets as well and even without a headset connected.

I ran memtest to test the CPU, but there was no issue, even with 100% usage. The core temperature never reached more than 60 or 70 degrees. Now I used FurMark to test the GPU and the PC always restarted after a couple of seconds, so I think that my GPU is broken. It did not run long enough to be too hot I guess.

Am I right that the GPU is the problem? Can the power adapter be the problem too and how do I verify either one?

,pcgamingtechsupport," I'm buying a pre built pc because it ended up being much cheaper than if I bought all the parts separate.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"So here's some clues before I go ahead and scrape this entire PC (bleh).

Right before the issue started, I had left my computer on for a few days and came back to turn on the monitor. Everything was frozen on the screen. I had tried plugging in a mouse and noticed there was no power coming to the mouse. Also the power button wasn't turning off the computer so I had to basically shut it down from the PSU.

From that point forward, turning it on results in everything turning on (mobo lights up, fans spin), and then having it shut down again (repeat). Nothing gets displayed on the monitor.

So I guess my question is, if the mobo lights up, does that mean the problem is not with the mobo or CPU or RAM? or could it easily be any of those things. And if everything lights up, does that mean it's not a problem with the PSU?

Hello everyone, Recently built a PC around 4 months ago here are its specs:

CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600x 6 core

GPU: AMD Radeon RX 5700

RAM: 2 (8GB Corsair Vengeance 3600 DDR4)

I can provide more specs if needed I just figured these are the important ones. Below is all the information in the error window:

Error code: 887A0005 (887A0006) (0xB93DE0A6)

signature: 4B9F9717

Location: 0x7FF911F83E49 (8305760/8329354)

I recently bought COD BOCW and ran it just fine with no issues for the first few hours of playing it. Upon trying to play the next day, The game will run for between 5-20 minutes and will then promptly crash and spit out that error code and a button to ""scan and repair"" which I did with no results. I also uninstalled and reinstalled the game and that did not work. League of Legends started to freeze up at random times for a few seconds as well but not crash. After this I factory reset my PC in hopes that it would be fixed but after re installing COD BOCW it keeps giving me that error message after a few minutes of having the game open.

First, i bought the PSU and the GPU and i was using it with a i7 7700k and was having no problem at all while gaming or so.

After two weeks, i bought the ryzen with the mobo, installed all and re installed windows.

Now, the pc randomly shut down when this things happen:

* Maximize or minimize a game
* Start a game

There's no relation with voltages of the PSU or heat because it can crash on the lobby or even when i open the game for first time. Also, i can let the game minimize for a while and when i want to go back, the pc shut down from nowhere.

I used the prime95 to stress memory and cpu without crash

Now, i put back the 7i 7700k to test if the mobo+cpu is the problem (had to reinstall windows because amd drivers make unestable with BSOD) but i don't think that a driver problem could be causing a shutdown without a BSOD.

First i was thinking about the new bios for this ryzen series but i didn't find anyone with the same issue.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"I’ve installed a new GPU a couple of days ago but I am not sure if it’s the card causing the issue or just a coincidence. 

Randomly from this morning my pc will randomly hang and become unresponsive, with the screen a couple of seconds later turning off then on again. The pc does not turn off at this time it’s always on. Once the screens turned back on the pc will work fine for a couple of minutes/ even an hour sometimes before doing it again. 

I’ve tested the RAM on windows tool and it came back with everything okay, and the CPU GPU temps seem to be fine with no weird spikes. I’m unsure what I can test next? I’ve heard people saying PSU and motherboard can cause these issues but my motherboards light isn’t flashing. 

The PSU is a RM750x
CPU 10600k at stock no overclock

&lt;p&gt;Randomly from this morning my pc will randomly hang and become unresponsive, with the screen a couple of seconds later turning off then on again. The pc does not turn off at this time it’s always on. Once the screens turned back on the pc will work fine for a couple of minutes/ even an hour sometimes before doing it again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tested the RAM on windows tool and it came back with everything okay, and the CPU GPU temps seem to be fine with no weird spikes. I’m unsure what I can test next? I’ve heard people saying PSU and motherboard can cause these issues but my motherboards light isn’t flashing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PSU is a RM750x

Hey!

sooo basically I’ve been playing wow on my old set up for about 3-4 years.. NO PROBLEMS AT ANY TIME!

2 weeks before SL I Upgraded my Motherboard and my CPU (along with new RAM and a new SSD) 

I installed everything I had installed before (just some things less, but nothing I had not installed before)!

3 days after the installation my pc hang up and threw me into windows „repair“ (couldn’t repair had to boot off another device) 

So i brought it back to the shop where I got the things from.. those people told me that I’m installing viruses which destroy my PC. (????) without checking the pc once. What ever I though, they fixed it and I installed the same things again.. 3 days after the exact same thing happened! 

What is the problem ?

Edit: I may have found the culprit - I forgot to reattach the WiFi antenna to my CPU. Read somewhere that the antenna boosts BT as well (being on the same frequency). Trying it out in a bit. Thanks for all the responses so far.


Hello, I've been trolling reddit and other sites to help find a resolution for my issue, but so far I have not found one that works, so trying my own post to see if it results to something.

I have an Xbox Wireless Controller (Carbon Black to be exact, if that matters), which I use to play on my PC. I'm literally less than 2 feet away from my monitor and CPU when I play on my PC.

My issue is that when I use a USB cable everything works fine but when I use Bluetooth, my controller disconnects every few seconds or so.

My setup is:

1. I added my controller using Control Panel &gt; Add Device (standard pairing via Bluetooth didn't work), based on this link: [https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows\_10-hardware-winpc/xbox-one-controller-wont-connect-via-bluetooth-but/ac4fefad-dbf5-4d6e-9ce3-05da6b0ac732?page=1](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware-winpc/xbox-one-controller-wont-connect-via-bluetooth-but/ac4fefad-dbf5-4d6e-9ce3-05da6b0ac732?page=1)
2. I have fresh batteries for the controller.
3. All drivers up-to-date, Windows 10 version 1909, build 18363.1198
4. MSI b550m pro-vdh wifi motherboard for Bluetooth receiver (Intel).
5. literally 1-2 feet distance between my CPU and my controller, no electronics in between that may cause interference.
6. I cannot change my WLAN channel to another frequency for the shitty reason that my ISP has locked our router and I still do not have admin access to it.

Troubleshooting done so far:

1. Reviewed all drivers and ensured everything up-to-date.
2. Windows already updated to latest version.
3. Tried turning off PC wifi, removing all Bluetooth devices connected except the controller itself
4. Removed all possible interference (phones, appliances, metals, etc.) in between CPU and
5. Tested at both close distance (1-2ft) and couch-to-TV distance (6-7ft)

Issue still exists.

Oddly, other input devices like my wireless keyboard and mouse (uses a Bluetooth receiver) works fine. However, a Bluetooth speaker I try to connect to the PC via Bluetooth also flakes out.

It may be painfully obvious at this point that it's my PC's Bluetooth receiver that has issues, but I'd like to get a second opinion from you guys before I go and buy a USB Bluetooth dongle.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"I posted about this on r/nvidia in their 457.30 driver discussion thread, but I was hoping if anyone has some way on how to fix this issue.

Ever since I updated my Nvidia Game Ready drivers to 457.30, I have had nothing but issues with game performance. I ran the Heaven benchmark and Cold War and they were both running super slow at averages of 20 fps. The Forza Horizon 4 Demo, the benchmark was running at 30 fps on 1440p with all Ultra settings.

I've tried using DDU, rolling back to version 457.09 or 456.71, hasn't shown anything fixed.

I've found that a temporary solution was to reinstall the drivers, but I would have to keep doing that every time I boot up my PC, or else I would be getting FPS drops. Once I reinstalled the drivers, the performance went up as expected, the Forza demo was averaging at 157 fps and the Heaven benchmark hit an FPS of around 134. However, once I turn off my PC or it reboots, that performance is gone and back to 20-30 fps and I have to spend like 15 minutes reinstalling the drivers again every time.

&amp;#x200B;

Specs:

GPU: GTX 1070

RAM: 24GB  1600Mhz G.Skills Ripjaw

Processor: i7-4790 3.6Ghz (stays at around 3.9)

PSU: NXT 650W GOLD

Mobo: ASUS MAXIMUS HERO VII

 

I recently upgraded to a GTX 1070 (from a 960) in hopes of getting a lot better frames on some of the games I play (Rust, Apex, PUBG, CS:GO, Valorant).

My problem is that I'm getting worse frames on games like CS and Valorant then I did with my GTX 960. I have MSI Afterburner so I can also see that my GPU will sometimes stay at around 15-20% even though I'm not at a steady 144ish frames on some light games like valorant or cs, uncapped. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Games like Rust I have received a little boost in fps however my GPU is nowhere near even reaching 65% usage. 

On Apex, my GPU will get pushed to like 80% and i'll have somewhat steady 144fps.

I also ran a benchmark and it pushed my GPU to 100% usage so I'm assuming it's not faulty.

My temps are great, they never went above 70C and regularly stay at around 55C.

&amp;#x200B;

Valorant all Low Settings : 110-140 fps

CS:GO all Low Settings: 90-140fps

&amp;#x200B;

I have used the DDU tool and followed the instructions, reinstalling every driver. I think my next step is  to reinstall OS as it seems to have helped others. I have optimized Geforce Experience and Nvidia Control Panel as well.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"I ordered a PC through NZXT BLD and just received it last week. It had few issues and I have a support ticket in with NZXT but they are taking a while to get back to me so I figured I would try posting here. All the problems I've had point to the GPU but at this point I'm not sure if it's a software or hardware issue. 

When I first plugged it in to set it up, it would not detect my displays properly. It would only show on my 1440p display in 1920x1080 and it would not connect to my 1080p display at all. I thought updating the drivers would fix that but it made it worse. After the update it started to continuously disconnect from the displays about every 5-10 seconds. While this was happening the GPU would not appear in task manager or any other software. 

I was able to fix that by using DDU to so a clean install of the drivers. (I did have to do it twice, it crashed after about an hour the first time and went back to the way it was.) 

 Now the PC seems to be working normally but it still crashes when I play games. I've tested a few games and they all run fine, but after a few minutes they crash and give me the same error about the GPU being removed or no longer detected. 

At this point I think it may be a hardware issue, but I would like to know if there is anything I'm missing or that I can try before sending it back. 

Any advice would be appreciated.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"TL:DR Getting various bluescreen codes on boot, do you suspect CPU or motherboard?

A few days ago, my browser tabs started crashing occasionally. Over the course of the next day, it progressed from this to the entire programs crashing, programs turning into black or white rectangles, my screens flashing between black and the desktop, before finally getting a bluescreen on every attempt to boot.

I have an i5-4690K on Asrock B85M-ITX with 16GB of Corsair RAM and a GTX 1060 6GB. I had a couple SSDs and an HDD and a CX 430M PSU. I built the computer around 2015 and have upgraded several things along the way so I was able to do some amount of troubleshooting, but I'm still not sure where my issue lies.

I am able to reliably get into safe mode, but will get anything from MEMORY_MANAGEMENT to BAD_POOL_CALLER to PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA when I try to boot normally. Because I suspected the GPU due to odd graphics behavior, I tried DDU and clean reinstall but no luck. I tested the GPU in another system and it appears to work there. I tried some older RAM that I know was working and that does not fix the issue either.

I removed all drives and got a spare to try loading a new copy of Windows, but when I use a Windows 10 DVD, I get bluescreened before the first prompt to install. This is where I'm a little more confused, because I don't have other parts that I can keep swapping in and out. I am not sure if I should be looking at the motherboard or CPU (or PSU if there's a way that could have caused this issue) because I don't have another compatible socket to verify what's wrong.

Have any of you experienced something like this? What do you think is more likely the issue? What could I try next? Let me know if you need more details.

&lt;p&gt;I am able to reliably get into safe mode, but will get anything from MEMORY_MANAGEMENT to BAD_POOL_CALLER to PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA when I try to boot normally. Because I suspected the GPU due to odd graphics behavior, I tried DDU and clean reinstall but no luck. I tested the GPU in another system and it appears to work there. I tried some older RAM that I know was working and that does not fix the issue either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I removed all drives and got a spare to try loading a new copy of Windows, but when I use a Windows 10 DVD, I get bluescreened before the first prompt to install. This is where I&amp;#39;m a little more confused, because I don&amp;#39;t have other parts that I can keep swapping in and out. I am not sure if I should be looking at the motherboard or CPU (or PSU if there&amp;#39;s a way that could have caused this issue) because I don&amp;#39;t have another compatible socket to verify what&amp;#39;s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have any of you experienced something like this? What do you think is more likely the issue? What could I try next? Let me know if you need more details. I appreciate you all!&lt;/p&gt;

So I started playing Shadow of War but every 15 minutes it kept crashing for some gpu problems. I searched online and several posts said to use DDU and it solved the problem to most people so I wanted to give it a shot and downloaded DDU.

I do that and uninstall the drivers and restart the pc. After I try to reinstall the drivers by downloading GameReady and Geforce Experience as usual but I found that during the installation of the programs themselves it ""load"" forever because it can't find the GPU.

I mean there is the GPU because the HDMI is on it but in device manager it calls it ""Microsoft Basic Display Adapter"" just made by Nvidia. Googling this it says that windows needs an update or something but there isn't one anywhere and if I search it goes on loop search here too. Under the update search it says in red ""Your device is missing important security and quality fixes."" but IT DOESN'T GIVE ME something to fix it.

I really don't know what to do I'm in full panic. My father will kill me if I broke the GPU and I already feel like a fucking idiot for doing so much damage to play a game...   fuck we cant even afford a new one now and he needs to work on here sometimes

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Just a casual day using my PC, I hit restart. What I thought it was a boot that took forever (although I have an M.2 NVMe) was in fact a lack of signal to the monitor.

The PC is like 2 months old (all parts new), except for the GPU, a 5 year-old Windforce GTX 960, that is a loan from a friend until I get my own.

This being said, my first guess is the GPU is dead (I hope no other components have issues). I didn't get any signals of a dying GPU, like artifacts on screen, black screens, loud fan noise, high temperatures, etc.

What I tried:

1. I canged the cable and ports.
2. I ran the monitor with a laptop. It works.
3. I connected the PC to another screen. It doesn't work.
4. I tried rebooting and there were no changes. PC boots normally, but there's nothing on the screen.

Update:

5. I tried with a brand-new GPU and still doesn't work. I'm starting to think it's the motherboard.


[My parts here](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/AndreiBri/saved/p7MbK8)

Solved!

It seems like my CMOS battery was at fault. Maybe it's discharged... idk. The fact is, I took it out, and I shorted the 2 pins for CMOS reset. After that, I tried to boot without the battery and it worked perfect. Tried again WITHOUT the battery; didn't work. Now I'm running it without the battery until I get a new one.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi everyone, 

Recently upgraded my PC, replaced pretty  much everything except the GPU. Been great for weeks but tonight just after a game of Warzone, which I don't play on very high settings and have frames locked to 60 and my PC cut off completely and could smell burning. I took the side panel off and tried to switch it back on and a little cloud of smoke came out of the GPU. 

Took the GPU out and PC boots again now. Is my trusty old graphics card dead and this is just a coincidence with the new PC or is there hope of a repair? I don't want to put it back in my PC in case it causes further damage. I can't help but think it's something I've replaced that's caused it because it's been in my old PC paired with a i7-4790k for 5 years-ish.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi, i have only recently got into pc gaming and i have a 3600x, gtx1080 and 32gb 3600mhz ram.

my games run great at 1440p and even sometimes 4k.

on cold war, i can run the game at 1440p ultra everything but raytracing (for obvious reasons) at a solid 60-75 fps.

on cold war, my game suddenly drops to 4fps, and when i manage to go into the settings to change a setting to fix it, it sorts itself out, even if if put the render resolution to higher than 2560x1440, then it happens again. i have tried turning these settings down and it still occurs, even when playing at 720p!

I have no idea how this happens as it happened too on warzone when i had a 4770k. i thought that was the issue but it obviously wasn't. 

it doesnt happen on any other games only cold war and warzone in the past.

I honestly dont have any idea why it does this and it is really frustrating.

Can someone please help me. 

Thanks Guys!

,pcgamingtechsupport,"New build pc, 
After two months while i was playing, the screen gets black and reconnect in 2 seconds,and then went back to normal. All was good. Next day I've tried to turn my pc on, but no boot, everything works (fans, lights) but no boot, no signal in TV.

It boot : orange, red, white, and stay in white. All fans working.


What I've tried :

New hdmi cable. 
rebuild it, checked connection cables, cmos rest, i used one ram in each slot, bios clear , booted without graphic card
 ( cpu comes with a graphic card ).
NOTHING WORKED.. SO because of the warranty i replaced  everything but the cpu, but same result . So it's definitely a cpu problem, i got new one and all went back to normal . 

----------

❗After two days i was browsing, Pc freeze, mouse is off, keyboard off. Couldn't do anything, i had to shut it down in the hard way. I turned it on , and i got the same problem, white led(vga) on motherboard, all fans working, no signal no boot..
Tried everything from zero but same thing .😢

I'm guessing the cpu is dead!!! I don't know what's wrong? I'm not doing overclocking, or messing with the bios settings! 

Now I'm waiting for a new cpu.. And I'm afraid to get the same results.. Any tips or ideas??

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hey guys,So I picked up a generic USB controller a couple of weeks ago.The OS (Win 10) recognizes the device, and in controller settings each and every one of the button presses are recognized correctly.

However, most most games I've tried simply ignore its existence.

I've made sure to enable controllers where possible, but no response, can't even re-map the buttons since no button presses are registered.

I've looked around the internet and tried to use the XBOX 360 controller emulator (which seems to be the most suggested solution) with no changes.  


All games I've tried officially support controllers.

Also, Some games (FF IV for example) do work!

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi   


So my friends Mic is not working in game and on discord etc as the title suggests, and I am at a loss.  
No amount of google is capable of solving the issue.   


I will explain what we have tried and what the issue actually is.   


What the issue is:  His mic works for recording, even using it on say WhatsApp web to record a voice message works. I can see his mic is active on games in party chat and shows the relative icons when he is speaking but no sound, ie. in COD and discord. I am not the only one who can't hear him and I can hear everyone else so definitely an issue on his end.   


What we have tried:  (Side note I may not get them all because I have tried every possible solution for him I can imagine, and even one's I never even thought of thanks to google hence my actual desperation to make a post)    


\-  Setting his mic to default (obviously),

\-  Setting the privacy on his mic to allow for apps (was already set for apps to use)

\- Checking the control panel settings with a hidden setting that I cannot remember with similar permission settings (I found on google can't remember exactly now) 

\- Updating drivers

\- Using a different mic I had spare 

\- Checking the sound tests in each chat app (Sound tests working can hear himself) 

\- Raising all volume levels to max in sound settings on windows and in whatever chat app

\- Using different USB ports

\- Restarting

\- Uninstalling drivers and re-installing

\- Manually installing drivers

\- Making sure mic(s) themselves were set at max volume 

\- Using multiple different chat apps

\- Removing devices from manager and starting again 

Genuinely a lot more, but the thing that broke my brain is the recording app on windows works, when he uses any party chat app, the mic tests they have work, he can hear himself during them, I can see he is talking through the icons, the fact that it's working over say a voice message on WhatsApp web. 

Is there something out the box someone can suggest that I may not have thought of, has anyone else come across this issue. I only found one person through google searches that had the same kind of issue but there was no solution on whatever forum it was posted just a lot of the basic suggestions all the way to including a complete re-install of the OS.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"New to this subreddit/the world of pc specs, so forgive me if anything I say sounds dumb lol.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start off by listing my specs:

&amp;#x200B;

OS: Win 10 pro

CPU:  Intel Core i3-8100

RAM: 8GB DDR4

Graphics card:  Radeon RX 570 Series

PSU: Corsair RM750

(any more info you need please let me know)

&amp;#x200B;

My PC has been having this issue where:

1. I play a high demanding game (in this case its Borderlands 3/Overwatch, BL3 is on the lowest settings possible and OVW is somewhat high)

2. \~40 mins+ of gaming pass and my monitor goes black. Not off to the point of a ""no signal"" message popping up, just a black screen, power still intact

3. PC either continues to stay on and I can't access anything unless I do a complete restart, or it shuts off. Sometimes it makes a very loud whirring noise on startup, but only for a second or two

4. PC boots up just fine, no error message, no popups, nothing, opens all programs normally

&amp;#x200B;

I've checked my monitors/monitor cables to see if they are faulty, dusted out the inside of my pc completely, making sure that my fans can spin with no interruption from any other cables, rearranged my cables, cleaned out my RAM discs, redid thermal paste, bought /an entire new PSU/ (foolish on my part, ik), played games until having the problem while keeping an eye on my temps by using Core Temp, ran Novabench to see if my pcu/gpu was testing badly ( I can share scores if that would help at all), looked on lots of different forums to see if anyone else was having this issue but no luck

&amp;#x200B;

It never happens outside of running any games, I can run low quality games just fine (Minecraft, Genshin Impact on lowest settings, Borderlands 2, more but you get the idea) but when I play BL3/OVW it has the issue. I could run those games fine with no issues, its become a problem within the past chunk of months.

&amp;#x200B;

A side note that I'm not sure if I should include or not/if its important, I've tried updating my Intel driver and the tool says that theres a new update avaliable and that my PC meets the requirements, but when I go to update it says that my computer isn't compatible. 

&amp;#x200B;

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi,

So I'm a cs player, I've been using GPU scaling in NV panel to make cs 75hz at 1024x768 stretched. I had few issues with calibrating it when I bought it few months ago but since then it's been okay.

I've been experiencing a lot of stuttering recently (since October but probably even before that) so today I figured I'd try to fix it so I restored global NVidia 3d settings and left csgo 3d settings unchanged (I had changed global settings to these csgo's but that wasn't optimal for other games), then the problem started. I just couldn't set my monitor to 75Hz with gpu scaling anymore, with both CRU and with Nvidia control panel. With display scaling instead, I could, but for some reason I couldn't set it to fullscreen stretched, it would only let me set it to this:

[proportions](https://i.imgur.com/6CbnkTG.jpg) - looks decent but it's a bit blurry and shiney (crosshair isn't sharp, it radiates its light)

[fullscreen](https://i.imgur.com/qmtPZAB.jpg) - it cuts the edges to the sides so unacceptable

[no scaling](https://i.imgur.com/XQTr1CB.jpg) - doesn't have either of issues mentioned above but, well, it looks comical with this small picture XD

All with display scaling.

With GPU scaling I couldn't just get that 75Hz option anyhow. The screen scales normal, it's just limited to 60Hz. It also has this weird blurry/shining effect proportions (display) had.

I'm using some cheap ass 1080p monitor and VGA cable but it isn't an issue since 75Hz was working before.

There's also one very interesting thing, with display scaling I've had one of the most smooth and fluent gameplays in years, felt like jumping from Intel Pentium to Ryzen 5900x. So I'd love to keep it at display but have no idea how to get the scaling right.

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m a cs player, I&amp;#39;ve been using GPU scaling in NV panel to make cs 75hz at 1024x768 stretched. I had few issues with calibrating it when I bought it few months ago but since then it&amp;#39;s been okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been experiencing a lot of stuttering recently (since October but probably even before that) so today I figured I&amp;#39;d try to fix it so I restored global NVidia 3d settings and left csgo 3d settings unchanged (I had changed global settings to these csgo&amp;#39;s but that wasn&amp;#39;t optimal for other games), then the problem started. I just couldn&amp;#39;t set my monitor to 75Hz with gpu scaling anymore, with both CRU and with Nvidia control panel.

We restarted the computer and no more blue screen appeared after. So we went back home and later in the day, my friend told us he got multiple blue screens randomly, somehow manage to play one-two hour of video game, than again random  multiple blue screens.

Errors were :

\- Kmode Exception not Handled

\- DPC Watchdog Violation

\- Kernel Mode Heap Corruption

\-  System Service Exception

\- Kmode Exception not Handled

\- kernel Security Check Failure

\- Driver IRQL Not Less or Equal

\- IRQL not less or equal

&amp;#x200B;

We tried to :

\- update drivers manually but that wouldn't work (PC was freezing to death or BSOD or telling the drivers were already on the last update)

\-  Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanupDism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

\- SFC scann (said corrected multiple errors and corrected them, but still having BSOD after this)

\- Bios motherboard update

\- Finally Reinstallation of Windows that didn't worked (still having multiple BSOD right after the installation)

Does someone have some clue to what's happening, or what we could try to fix this ? He will bring the computer to us tomorrow so we can work on it in a more easy way (cause we tried everything i said above on video call with him). Thanks !

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT : Fixed it ! SO i read things on the internet for hours before finding some interesting things about the RAM being not always well handled by AMD and/or the motherboard i use. So what i did was kinda simple but pretty counter intuitive.. I turned ON the XMP profile.. and also installed the AMD software for chipset drivers (from amd website) and .. it worked. Actually i have 4 hours running without any blue screens, did some tests, stress tests, chilling on the computer waiting if a blue screen would show up, and nothing, just a perfectly working computer. For some reason the Ram wasn't well handled because of the 3000mhz and CAS 15.

&lt;p&gt;- SFC scann (said corrected multiple errors and corrected them, but still having BSOD after this)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Bios motherboard update&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Finally Reinstallation of Windows that didn&amp;#39;t worked (still having multiple BSOD right after the installation)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does someone have some clue to what&amp;#39;s happening, or what we could try to fix this ? He will bring the computer to us tomorrow so we can work on it in a more easy way (cause we tried everything i said above on video call with him). Thanks !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT : Fixed it ! SO i read things on the internet for hours before finding some interesting things about the RAM being not always well handled by AMD and/or the motherboard i use. So what i did was kinda simple but pretty counter intuitive.. I turned ON the XMP profile.. and also installed the AMD software for chipset drivers (from amd website) and .. it worked. Actually i have 4 hours running without any blue screens, did some tests, stress tests, chilling on the computer waiting if a blue screen would show up, and nothing, just a perfectly working computer. For some reason the Ram wasn&amp;#39;t well handled because of the 3000mhz and CAS 15. &lt;/p&gt;

I have a question, i play most of the time Destiny 2 on my pc on 4k  75hz all the time on my LG 27GN950

Last 3 weeks i played on 4k at 60hz (capped) preparing my self for the ps5.

Today i got my brand new ps5, hooked it on my LG monitor and the gameplay is just terrible, its not like when i was playing on my pc.

The settings are the same
4k 60hz on both of the systems with the same monitor.

I even tried to play on my ps5 on 1080p with 60 hz (120hz will added tru update on 8 december)

Who can jt be that there is a big difference while the video settings are the same ?

,pcgamingtechsupport,"I have a flickering issue with my monitors. The flickering is very prominent on the RTX2070 (you can see it nearly all the time) but on the GTX970 you can see it well when you first start the PC then it only occurs occasionally after about 30 mins.

Initially thinking it was an issue with the 2070 I requested a replacement, which Scan found to have a flickering issue and a fault with one of the HDMI ports. The second 2070 had the same issue for me and when they tested it, it failed the Heaven benchmark. The third 2070 still had the same issue for me but they found no fault and are testing another before they send it to me. (I currently do not have a 2070 to test any theories) The last update on this was two weeks ago (05/11/2020) where they asked ""if there is anything specific you would like us to try and do with the product to be able to try and replicate your problem."" I asked them to try and replicate my system, specifically focusing on the PSU, as my theory at the time was that the increased power draw of the new graphics card was causing issues. At that point, I hadn't seen the flickering on the 970. My current thinking is the issue is with the monitors.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the list of things I have tried to fix the issue: 

* plugged different cable into each monitor - eliminates cable issue
* flickering only appears on one monitor at a time and has been present on both (when using 2070)
* tried looking for a monitor driver but AOC don't have one 
* reinstalled Nvidia driver
* Tried different ports on the graphics card
* put variable refresh rate on in the display/graphics setting
* plugged in 970 graphics card, flicker present but only one DP so used DP+HDMI (flicker is less prominent and seems to stay on one half on the main screen)
* no flicker present when using 1070 card, using 2 DisplayPorts
* tried old graphics card drivers:
   * \-441.87
   * \-442.19
   * \-442.50
   * \-445.87
   * \-451.61
* used Outervision PSU calculator- 520w should be adequate
* tried 2070 in a different pc with different monitors- no issues (20 min test)
* tried 2070 in a different pc with my AOC monitors- no issues (1-hour test)

&amp;#x200B;

My specs:

Motherboard: ASUS Z97-P

CPU: I5-4690K

GPU: EVGA GTX 970/Gigabyte RTX 2070

RAM: 4x 4GB DDR3 

PSU: Seasonic M12 bronze - 520W

Storage: SATA SSD, SATA 7.2K RPM

Monitors: 2x AOC AGON AG273QX (1440p, 144hz)

&amp;#x200B;

If I can help it I want to avoid returning the monitors until there is no other alternative, as When I returned one of the original monitors (9 dead pixels) to AOC it took 3.5 months to receive the refund. I also need to use the monitors for working from home.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Flickering present on AOC AGON AG273QX Monitors. Flickering is prominent when using RTX2070 and occasional with a GTX970.

A few days ago and all of a sudden my gaming rig started to make very weird and loud noise, which I allocated to the AiO-cooler as described in the title (see [video](https://vimeo.com/user127698810/review/482354194/d80ee2bde1)). I took the opportunity to clean my PC, apply some new thermal grease and also mounted the cooling block in the opposite way as it would fit better in my rig and also to see wether the old position could have been the reason for the noise. Sadly the noise comes back from time to time and I need some advice from you guys. I feel like the air in the system might be the problem (see [photo](https://postimg.cc/Xrfbs2M9)). I also observed that the cpu seems to have cooling issues as it is loaded by only 60% before reaching 100°C and therefore being thermally throttled which shouldn't occur at all with a water cooled non overclocked I7-6700k. Do I just need to refill the loop or might the pump be broken?

Hi guys,

My brother is a huge fan of CS GO and has spent hundreds of dollars on the game. After a recent update (around June maybe), there is a huge drop in fps. He now gets only 40- 60 fps constantly, before the update he used to get 350-400 fps. System specs : 16GB RAM, GTX 1070-Ti gaming pc.

Already tried options:Drivers updated, Steam re-installed CS, go re-installed, Launch options were set, removed and set again, and Max fps set to 999

Can you please suggest what can be done to improve? I really want to play cs go with my brother :(

The subreddit [r/GlobalOffensive](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/) has referred me to this one. Please help.

On the two games I play, Rocket League and CS:GO, the game is basically unplayable without Vsync on. The performance is very stable: On Rocket League I get a consistent 120-140 fps without any fps drops, yet it feels awful. It feels like I'm playing on 10 fps, not 120. It's so jittery I can almost make out individual frames(same issue on CSGO). However, the moment I turn on Vsync, it's buttery smooth. However it's horrible to play with Vsync on because of the input lag it causes.

My brother told me this was because of the game producing higher fps than the display refresh rate. However, isn't it true that even at 60hz, 120fps should feel slightly better than 60? In other words, 'you can't have too much fps'? I've played the same games on two different computers, both having 60hz displays, and even when the framerate exceeded 60 it was fine, and actually felt better.

So far I've tried capping the fps to 60 with Vsync off (still feels terrible) and messing around in the Nvidia Control Panel to no avail. I'd really appreciate if anyone knew how to fix this.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hey all,

I was wondering whether I could ask for a bit of assistance and I have two questions.

My brother passed away earlier this year and I don’t know what to do with his old gaming PC. It’s been a very long time since I built or customised a PC (and even then I didn’t know what I was doing) so am a bit clueless.

I have three photos (sorry they’re rubbish - if I need to take anymore I can do so when I go back to my mum’s house) - one showing a top down, one showing the graphics card model, the other showing a (tiny!) SSD.

1. From these, admittedly, very inadequate images, can you tell whether this is a fairly new gaming PC? (I.e. one worth me trying to set up for myself). Obviously I’ve googled these components but frankly it doesn’t tell me much about whether I should keep the pc or give to charity.

2. The second question is the odder one. My brother used to access the dark web and buy drugs (ultimately leading to his passing away). I do not want to use (and connect to my network) a PC that has anything dodgy/dangerous/incriminating etc. on it unless doing a clean format of the HD would sort this out. I obviously do not have his log in details for anything so I assume I’d need to use BIOS somehow?

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From these, admittedly, very inadequate images, can you tell whether this is a fairly new gaming PC? (I.e. one worth me trying to set up for myself). Obviously I’ve googled these components but frankly it doesn’t tell me much about whether I should keep the pc or give to charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second question is the odder one. My brother used to access the dark web and buy drugs (ultimately leading to his passing away). I do not want to use (and connect to my network) a PC that has anything dodgy/dangerous/incriminating etc. on it unless doing a clean format of the HD would sort this out. I obviously do not have his log in details for anything so I assume I’d need to use BIOS somehow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance&lt;/p&gt;

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi all,

I've noticed an issue as of the last couple of months whilst using my computer to stream to my friends and try and start up a fun-filled channel. The only problem is, my PC appears to be throttling my upload speed directly related to my home internet. Not just wifi, but ethernet connected directly to the NBN outlet in my apartment.

I've tried calling my ISP and they informed me that my internet services were fine. I'm currently on the **100/40** **Mbps** plan with Mate internet, who have provided excellent service since I moved in May 2019. 

After multiple calls and tests, I finally decided to simultaneously test my mobile connection to the same internet, and my mobile displayed accurate test results. My PC downloads are pretty much always on par with what is expected (90Mbps around there), but my uploads are as low as 3-7Mbps when my mobile and work laptop test at the standard 38-ish Mbps. 

PC Build:

* CPU - Intel s1151 Core i9 9900K
* GPU - Asus  ROG Strix NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 OC Edition 8GB
* Mobo - MSI S1151 ATX MPG Z390 GAMING PRO CARBON AC DDR4
   * Wifi Card - Intel Wireless-AC 9560
* RAM - Corsair 2666MHz Vengeance LPX BLACK RAM PN CMK32GX4M2A2666C16
* Boot SSD - Samsung 500GB SSD 970 EVO Plus

I've tried the following to no avail:

* Resetting network in network settings
* Troubleshooting network issues
* Updating all networking drivers direct from Intel's website
* Updating BIOS
* Looking into using Google DNS (sped up by 1/2Mbps upload speed
* Disabling &amp; re-enabling drivers
* Bypass wifi by using ethernet, same throttled upload speed}
* Using Intel's Driver &amp; Support Assistant to check/update components in my PC
* Using DriverBooster to update any other drivers that may have been missed
* Emailed both Intel &amp; MSI (motherboard manufacturer) to assist as this is a custom built pc (which had been working completely fine for over 13 months)
   * Checking my Intel wifi card base settings in device properties &gt; Advanced tab (had not been changed from their recommendations)
* Disabled firewall when testing speeds to ensure not prevented by the firewall
* Only using Windows defender antivirus software

Having trouble posting images of my build &amp; network tests to prove the discrepancy on my home network, apologies!

**Edit**

After a mention from EnterpriseNL, my computer is now working flawlessly.  Thank you all for the support to my query!

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Obviously a stupid question. Yes is the answer. 

However. I have been trouble shooting for a fortnight my new PC which was stuttering in every game. Now about half the games I’ve tried have varying levels of stutter issues. Some only when the graphic options are turned up. 

I had similar issue on my previous PC and the one thing I have reused from that build is the RAM. I also had issues with the ram not being detected and taking them out and trying again only 1 or 2 sticks were being detected. This could have been me still learning and perhaps doing something wrong. But I think it was worth noting. Now all are working. 

Benchmarks seem to think everything is fine. The motherboard has been flashed and full install done by a computer shop near me and this has helped maybe 15% of the games that stuttered. Everything is up to date. I’ve tried numerous Nvidia Control Panel settings for specific game titles. Tomorrow I’m going to try some one else’s graphics card and hopefully ram to see what happens there. My mobo is quite new and someone suggested maybe it has been updated enough? https://www.umart.com.au/Asus-ROG-Strix-Z490-F-Gaming-LGA-1200-ATX-Motherboard_55138G.html That’s it there.

2X Corair vengeance ddr4 8gb @ 3000mhz
i should note that when i upgraded my motherboard to the one currently in the spec list... well i forgot to heat the thermal paste and kind of pulled the cooler slowly with little force to then with alot and well it pulled the cpu from the socket without opening it. i know im sorry. but it bent a full row of pins but i was able to install it and it worked fine. 



So basically my problems started with a windows update. A couple days after i got a blue screen unfortunately i cannot remember the code... you'll understand why soon. Then my pc wouldn't reboot so i pressed the reset button. In turn the dram led came on and my pc would no longer post. After removing the sticks and fiddling around i came to the Conclusion that the B2 ram slot was no longer working. I know it's the slot because the ram works in the others woth xmp on or off. i was using my pc as normal waiting for Sunday to come around to try to fix the issue as i was busy most of the day. It is not yet Sunday and the time of writing this but i had some free time. so first thing i did was update my bios to version 1202. Woop woop ram was working as normal until it wasnt. When i restarted my system it was gone again. The dram light was on again. I switched back to the working preset which was slot A1 and A2. I then decided to do a fresh windows install after some struggling of trying to get my ssd to cooperate and let me install i got there and once again it worked and once again it stopped. I got another blue screen after booting in this configuration talking about wireless drivers being the cause. i unistalled my wireless drivers when suddenly windows just wouldn't work. Another clean install later windows ran into more problems now on the third install i got quite far i had all but 4 drivers installed and when i used driver booster to install them thinking they were insignificant, well after restarting the pc to finish the update it froze on the lock screen.The ram was working fine after multiple restarts in slot B2 and A2 just after those last four drivers got updated that's when it started again. I tried running xmp to basically see was it working and it went again with dram light on. Driver booster made a restore point before updating the drivers but my bootable usb media wouldn't recognize it. It keeps telling me to restart and select the windows version which i obviously can't do and theres no option to reset or run in safe mode. My bootable media is from 2018.Im scared to remove the cpu incase of further damage but i do have the option to RMA the motherboard i would really appreciate some help im sorry i can't be more specific with stop codes i got so frustrated i just can't remember them Thank you.",t2_52kisxjv,False,,0,False,I have a very difficult pc problem i could use some help with.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Troubleshooting'}]",r/pcgamingtechsupport,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_jyn8jj,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Troubleshooting,False,2,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1606038534.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.pcgamingtechsupport,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My specs.

i should note that when i upgraded my motherboard to the one currently in the spec list... well i forgot to heat the thermal paste and kind of pulled the cooler slowly with little force to then with alot and well it pulled the cpu from the socket without opening it. i know im sorry. but it bent a full row of pins but i was able to install it and it worked fine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically my problems started with a windows update. A couple days after i got a blue screen unfortunately i cannot remember the code... you&amp;#39;ll understand why soon. Then my pc wouldn&amp;#39;t reboot so i pressed the reset button. In turn the dram led came on and my pc would no longer post. After removing the sticks and fiddling around i came to the Conclusion that the B2 ram slot was no longer working. I know it&amp;#39;s the slot because the ram works in the others woth xmp on or off. i was using my pc as normal waiting for Sunday to come around to try to fix the issue as i was busy most of the day. It is not yet Sunday and the time of writing this but i had some free time. so first thing i did was update my bios to version 1202. Woop woop ram was working as normal until it wasnt. When i restarted my system it was gone again. The dram light was on again. I switched back to the working preset which was slot A1 and A2. I then decided to do a fresh windows install after some struggling of trying to get my ssd to cooperate and let me install i got there and once again it worked and once again it stopped. I got another blue screen after booting in this configuration talking about wireless drivers being the cause. i unistalled my wireless drivers when suddenly windows just wouldn&amp;#39;t work. Another clean install later windows ran into more problems now on the third install i got quite far i had all but 4 drivers installed and when i used driver booster to install them thinking they were insignificant, well after restarting the pc to finish the update it froze on the lock screen.The ram was working fine after multiple restarts in slot B2 and A2 just after those last four drivers got updated that&amp;#39;s when it started again. I tried running xmp to basically see was it working and it went again with dram light on. Driver booster made a restore point before updating the drivers but my bootable usb media wouldn&amp;#39;t recognize it. It keeps telling me to restart and select the windows version which i obviously can&amp;#39;t do and theres no option to reset or run in safe mode. My bootable media is from 2018.Im scared to remove the cpu incase of further damage but i do have the option to RMA the motherboard i would really appreciate some help im sorry i can&amp;#39;t be more specific with stop codes i got so frustrated i just can&amp;#39;t remember them Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

Does it have to be a parts problem? Even if RAM checked out could that be the issue or any other parts?

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hello all,

I have come to your lair in the hopes of great wisdom, so that i can get more frames whilst playing video games.

It is my first post here, so ill try and stick to all the rules, however please let me know if i break any and i will correct them asap.

I recently upgraded my CPU from an i5-6500 to AMD Ryzen 5 3600x, which resulted in a much smoother experience in warzone.

Before buying the CPU, i watched a video of my current setup in warzone, ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puAPv9Z5wgM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puAPv9Z5wgM)) which shows much higher frames per second, compared to what i get. (Ryzen 5 3600x + RTX 2060 Super + 16 gb 2133mhz RAM)

Now, in some areas, i can hit perhaps 150 fps, those are mostly the out in nowhere areas. The moment i go to an urban area (yes i am aware that frames might drop there) i plummit down to 90-110 ish. To test this out, i run the exact same settings as the youtube video, drivers are all updated and i even drop the same places as the guy in the video, yet, i dont get close to the same results as him.

Anyone got any ideas of what might be causing this issue? the video is from June 2020, but i cant make myself believe that instead of fixing the game, making everyones FPS better, they would go the direct oppisite direction. However, it is afterall Activision.

Im open to any suggestions, come with ideas i should try out, or something that dramatically increased YOUR fps.

(Yes, i've seen these different youtube videos of people coming up with all kinds of things to do to get better fps, but they dont know why it increases fps. I dont trust people like them.)

&amp;#x200B;

My benchmarks are here, took me a few tries to understand that having 800 chrome tabs open, wont make your benchmarks any better.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi, I've recently purchased new components for a Ryzen build. The build:

Ryzen 7 3700x

16GB Corsair Vengeance Pro 3200 CL16

MSI MPG B550 Gaming Plus

(Components that aren't new are:

Gigabyte GTX 1070

Corsair CX650M

and my SSDs/HDD)

For the case I went with the NZXT H510 Elite. This case comes with 2 NZXT AER RGB 2 fans included, which are connected to the Smart Device v2 RGB/Fan controller (included as well). The Ryzen came with the Wraith Prism cooler, which is also RGB capable.

Both, the cooler and the RGB fan controller by NZXT, are connected to the mobo via a USB header.

Now something really weird happens, something I have never seen in my years of building PCs before. While connected to the mobo via the USB headers, both devices, the controller and the cooler, lose connection seemingly at random, just to reconnect a split second later. Depending on vibrations in and around the case, this connecting/disconnecting thing may happen every second, with windows playing that usb connect/disconnect sound 10 times in a row. While this happens, the NZXT usb device disappears and reappears in the device manager and the rgb software gains and loses connection to the fans (the amd prism cooler loses its lighting profile as well). This appears to affect the whole system from time to time, since my playstation controller as well as usb mouse and keyboard lose and regain connection, too.

A possible solution for this is to apply pressure with my finger directly on the motherboard. At first I thought pushing on one of the headers would help, but it doesn't matter if I push on the headers or somewhere else. The farther away from the usb pins I push, the more pressure I have to apply to keep a constant connection. This is reproducable 100% of the time. I tried tightening the screws that hold the mobo but unfortunately I cant screw them further in anymore.

I really dont know why pushing on the circuit board would help with what appears to be loose connections. Or is it something else entirely? Is it maybe a power issue? To many devices using usb? I cant tell and this pushing solution just creates more questions. I also thought that maybe the small current that flows through my fingers had something to do with it, but pushing with any object, while applying enough force, resulted in a stable connection for all devices.

Hope yall can untie this mess. Are the usb pins defective, is this a bios issue, should I get the same board again or is it a psu thing?

,pcgamingtechsupport,"I've posted before and feel I'm getting ever-nearer to the problem itself.  I've been having occasional frame drops and visual stutters in nearly all games and sometimes when doing video playback (personal movies on Amazon and in Youtube videos) and I've been fiddling with system settings and in-game settings alike to try to flush out the issue, but it remains an irritation.  The games are certainly playable enough, but it's an irritant that I would prefer to be not present, you know?

My current specs are a Ryzen 7 3700X, GTX 1070 Ti, Crucial MX500 1 TB SSD, and Patriot 3600 C17 Series 2x 8GB.  It's a pretty good system, I'd think, so the in-game stutters (mild as they are) and in video playback should be near-nonexistent.

My monitor is an LG 32GK650F-B 32"" QHD 144 Hz with FreeSync (which is now currently enabled and did not fix the issue).  I also use an Oculus Quest 1 with the Link software and a decent third-party cable, and that stutters in PC VR games, too, so it's not just an issue with the monitor, I think.

Hello, 

Thank you if you take the time to read my problem !:)

I've been having a problem since I got my new ""PNY GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER XLR8 Gaming Overclocked Edition"" graphics card. (I had a GTX 970 that stopped working).

When I'm on my desktop / internet / series, I have a part of the screen that ""jumps"" very briefly, it doesn't even last a second, it happens irregularly (sometimes several times a minute, sometimes nothing for 10 minutes). BUT I do not encounter this problem while playing game. 
My screen is an AOC 24"" LED - 24G2U/BK. I don't encounter this error on my second ASUS PA238 screen but I want to be able to enjoy my main monitor without worries. 

Video of the problem : https://streamable.com/4694fp

I have already done :

-Changing DisplayPort Cable to HDMI

-Uninstalled driver and reinstalled 

-Then used Display Driver Uninstaller DDU

-Changed the 16x PCI Express slot graphics card. 

-Switch the screen to 60Hz

-Checked FreeSync and Gsync compatibility options in Nvidia settings

-Changed Nvidia settings ""Activate G-sync, compability G-Sync"" from ""Activate for full screen"" to ""Activate for borderless fullscreen"" (I thought it could work since I have no problem while gaming but it's always happening on desktop.)

The bug disappears from my screen if I don't connect it to the 1660 Super graphics card but use the graphics chipset of my CPU instead. 
As I said the bug is not present if I plug the graphics card on my other screen. 

Items in my config that could help : 

-Screen: AOC 24"" LED - 24G2U/BK - 144Hz

-Second screen : ASUS PA238 - 60Hz

-Processor: Intel Core i7 4790K - 4.0 ~4.4 Ghz

-Cooling: Corsair H60 (Watercooling)

-Motherboard: ASUS Z97-Pro Gamer

-Graphics Card: PNY GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER XLR8 Gaming Overclocked Edition

-RAM: Corsair Vengeance DDR3-1600 CL9 LP 16GB (4 x 4GB)

-Power Supply: Cooler Master G750M 80+ Bronze

-OS : Windows 10 v1909

I would tend to think that the problem comes from the graphic card I received because with my old graphic card I didn't have this problem. But I truly don't know, could it be the monitor ? Both GPU &amp; Monitor are recent and under warranty but I would take a long time I think and I'm not even sure where is the problem coming from.

&lt;p&gt;Thank you if you take the time to read my problem !:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been having a problem since I got my new &amp;quot;PNY GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER XLR8 Gaming Overclocked Edition&amp;quot; graphics card. (I had a GTX 970 that stopped working).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#39;m on my desktop / internet / series, I have a part of the screen that &amp;quot;jumps&amp;quot; very briefly, it doesn&amp;#39;t even last a second, it happens irregularly (sometimes several times a minute, sometimes nothing for 10 minutes). BUT I do not encounter this problem while playing game. 
My screen is an AOC 24&amp;quot; LED - 24G2U/BK. I don&amp;#39;t encounter this error on my second ASUS PA238 screen but I want to be able to enjoy my main monitor without worries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video of the problem : &lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/4694fp""&gt;https://streamable.com/4694fp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have already done :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Changing DisplayPort Cable to HDMI&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Uninstalled driver and reinstalled &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Then used Display Driver Uninstaller DDU&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Changed the 16x PCI Express slot graphics card. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Switch the screen to 60Hz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Checked FreeSync and Gsync compatibility options in Nvidia settings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Changed Nvidia settings &amp;quot;Activate G-sync, compability G-Sync&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;Activate for full screen&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Activate for borderless fullscreen&amp;quot; (I thought it could work since I have no problem while gaming but it&amp;#39;s always happening on desktop.)&lt;/p&gt;

Temps are reaching 95 degrees C when playing BFV. Currently mid-low 50s when typing this out. Room temp is 70 degrees F.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"So I recently got myself a gaming set up, I'm super new to all of this. I have a 65"" Samsung 80t, which is connected to my new PC and the new Xbox.

When I was trying to set up the xbox, the tv would go purple and lined and glitchy upon loading some games. Looking it up, I saw that my tv needed a firmware update, from 1402 to 1403.

Upon installing the update, the xbox worked wonderfully, 4k 120Hz. An unintended side effect was my PC suddenly was also able to do those settings, and I was so happy.

Cut to a few days later and I notice my picture has degraded quality. Like my backlight is maybe too bright or something, it looks washed out, and I no longer have the ability to set my PC to 4k 120Hz.

The 80t has one gaming port, and I was using that for the Xbox, but the other one seemed to work for the PC and its settings. Today, trying to fix it, I unplugged the xbox from HDMI 4 (the gaming one) and my PC into it, and I still cant get 4k @ 120Hz.

Few days ago I noticed some low fps in game for example RDR2, when I had no problem with settings from Geforce Experience. I had 35-40 in biggest town in game and 40-50 fps in fields.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi everyone! My CPU has been overheating the last couple of months and I'm not sure why. Temps have been consistently above 90 Celsius when I play any type of game. Tried cleaning the fans and updating Windows, but so far no luck. I'm using stock fans from the LanCool 2. CPU temp doesn't go down when I lower my configurations either.

Any help or advice would be appreciated. This is my first time posting on this forum too, so please let me know if there's any other info that would be helpful to provide. I have added my temps reported by Speccy and the Userbenchmark. Thank you.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hey guys, thanks for the interest.

This will be relatively short, given that I'm a bit of a nub here and can't really articulate my problem too well.

I recently picked up a new RTX 3070 and an ASUS VG27AQ monitor. This is a 27"" 1440p monitor that I am running along side a crappy old 24"" 1080p monitor. I upgraded the video card about 2 days before upgrading the monitor.

So far all is well, however, I've noticed a new anomaly in my experience with AC: Valhalla ever since the monitor upgrade. Every now and then the screen will go black for about a second and then come back.It appears that the game switches from fullscreen @ 144hz to borderless @ 60hz. I change it back and it stays for a bit, but inevitably it flips back. Very annoying! This seems to be correlate with the new monitor purchase as I did not have the issue when I was on my old monitor with the 3070. I have not noticed any FPS drops or any oddities before the screen blanks.

Could this have something to do with G-Sync? Or is there a setting conflict Im not aware of? I ask this because when I wake my PC up from sleep it spends a good while sorting out the resolution issues (That is to say, the second monitor resolution changes a bit before settling on 1920 x 1080, then the primary (VG27AQ) monitor wakes up and does the same thing before settling on it's proper resolution) then Windows advises me to finish setting up G-Sync. So far it seems to be setup properly in the Nvidia control panel? I suspect these two issues are correlated but I dont have the knoweldge or insight to connect them.

I am 100% open to trouble shooting here but Im just not sure where to begin!

But for some reason every time I turn on my computer in order for me to get visuals on the monitor, I have to plug my DisplayPort into my mobo, turn on the PC, shut it down, then switch the cable back into my GPU, then I get a working display once turned on again. If the computer is off and I turn it straight on, with the DisplayPort into the GPU, there is ""no signal"" from my monitor.

This isn't what I want to be dealing with every time I turn on my PC. Any fixes or similar experiences? I used DDU to uninstall the AMD drivers, and now have the Nvidia drivers installed, but no change. Much appreciated for the help in advance.

I have a new-ish PC that recently started acting oddly. It was fine for months (at least I didn't notice the issue), but lately it will act weird. I first noticed it playing Fortnite with my daughter. If I'm running forward I'll see a slight dip in FPS (locked at 60 but I'll see 54ish) and my mouse won't respond accurately. Also, if I'm running forward and the issue hits, I'll keep running forward even if I let go or move another direction until the stutter clears.

I tried lowering graphics settings, but that didn't help. I had copied my user profile from an old PC and the issue was so annoying that I completely reinstalled the OS on a different HDD as well. Issue persisted, but then I realized I was a moron and forgot a few drivers. Updated those and the issue seemed to abate, but then I realized it just takes time to manifest. Clean install, totally up to date, after X time it starts to stutter. Then I finally noticed that it will happen anywhere, not just games. If I'm typing in FB the text will stop showing up but if I continue typing, it'll all spit out after the stutter. At first I thought it might be either FB or a memory leak in Chrome, so I totally uninstalled Chrome and stayed off FB, but even still after however long, the issue seems to pop up.

Further, it happens on my daughter's PC as well I'm finding. She was complaining about lag in Fortnite, so I tried the same steps of lowering gfx settings to fuzzy potato and doing updates. Her computer will still stutter, cache typing, and have a jittery mouse for a few seconds even when not playing games and just using the internet.

Daughter's PC is my old one. i7-6700k with GTX970. Not amazing, but it wasn't acting like this when I had it. My new PC is a Ryzen 3700x with a GTX2070 Super definitely shouldn't have issues running Fortnite on medium or typing in FB. It also was not doing this when it was first built. I find it odd that both started doing the same thing around the same time but it makes me suspect something like Windows itself as there's pretty much nothing in common between the two beyond that.",t2_4vyhocio,False,,0,False,"Stuttering everywhere, not just gaming.","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Performance issue'}]",r/pcgamingtechsupport,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_jyh6t0,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Performance issue,False,1,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1606016752.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.pcgamingtechsupport,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;[UserBenchmarks: Game 103%, Desk 85%, Work 109%](&lt;a href=""https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/35752862""&gt;https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/35752862&lt;/a&gt;)  &lt;/p&gt;

Yesterday I assembled, my pc, at first I had a problem with the bios, but reseting the CMOS worked. Now I have a problem with windows!!

I created a bootable USB using the windows media Creation tool. It got stuck on the windows logo (even before I could select a drive to install to) I formatted the usb, reinstalled everything and the same problem occurs.

I also tried a 32gb usb stick that came with the files pre-installed, it askes me if I want to install 64 or 32 bit windows. I need 64 bit so when I check that, it proceeds to a screen that gets shown on startup (mobo manufacturer) and it is stuck on this screen.

Reseated cpu and ram.

Tried only one ram slot (with all ram modules) and still the same problem. I don't think it is one of my 2 ram modules since it does detect a change in my config/shows correct amounts/ shows correct timings

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi guys! I need some help diagnosing my issue.

First, my setup:

Ryzen 5 3600 
GTX 1080 Gigabyte Windforce
2x8 GB G.Skill Ripjaws (running at 3466mhz)
MSI B450 Tomahawk
PS XPG Core 650W
Crucial MX500 500GB (Windows)
Crucial BX500 1TB (Games and garbage)

Issue: Games will freeze for a few seconds and then crash. No error messages. Forza Horizon 4, Hitman, Hitman 2, GTA V, etc. They all do the same. The only game that does not randomly crash is League of Legends but if I Alt + Tab during the game, it will crash. For some reason it does not happen during the loading screen. This started happening just a few days ago and the windows error log does not give a lot of information but says that the error is affecting  Kernelbase.dll so I might have to install Windows again.

Things that have changed recently:

Upgraded RAM. I was running 2x8 GB Corsair 3000mhz and got 3600mhz but my movo won’t take anything over 3466 so I had to adjust the speed. This happened a couple of weeks ago and I don’t think it is crashing the games as I was able to play just fine for almost 2 weeks.

Started running a Linux virtual machine a few weeks ago. I don’t think this is the problem but you never know. Games were running just fine for weeks tho.

Updated Windows. I am almost sure this is the issue based on the Windows error log but I’d like to know what other things I can try before doing a clean install as it takes ages and it is definitely the last resort.

I have checked temps and everything is the same. Both the CPU and GPU have had the same temps for months.

What do you think? Any ideas? Thank you!


UPDATE 1: Updated Nvidia drivers and the issue was the same.

UPDATE 2:Update Frameworks (pending update) and the issue was the same. This was known to cause crashes.

UPDATE 3: Started playing with my ram overclocking and lowered the frequency (kept the same timings) and it seems to have fixed the issue. I played R2R2 high settings for quite some time and no crashes. It seems like this might have fixed the issue.

I need some help diagnosing my issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, my setup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryzen 5 3600 
GTX 1080 Gigabyte Windforce
2x8 GB G.Skill Ripjaws (running at 3466mhz)
MSI B450 Tomahawk
PS XPG Core 650W
Crucial MX500 500GB (Windows)
Crucial BX500 1TB (Games and garbage)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issue: Games will freeze for a few seconds and then crash. No error messages. Forza Horizon 4, Hitman, Hitman 2, GTA V, etc. They all do the same. The only game that does not randomly crash is League of Legends but if I Alt + Tab during the game, it will crash. For some reason it does not happen during the loading screen.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi. At June 6th, I finished building my first PC. 

All good, up until a week ago, when I shut down and a Windows Update kicked in.

The day after, Windows suddenly didn’t recognize one of my storage M.2 SSD, as if it never existed. All of my games and work were missing. Tried everything, and the solution I found was to open the BIOS, so the computer sets in and recognizes it before initializing Windows 10. 

Everyday is a new problem. Today, I woke up to find all of my Steam games “Corrupted”, ALL OF THEM. It takes so much time to uninstall the games, and even more time to download them. My internet test is at 412MB/s, and I never had this trouble; but now, it took 13 minutes to download 166MB, and it stopped due to no network. Never had this problem. 

Have in mind, throughout this 5 month period, I would turn off my PC and the fans would go INSANELY FAST and a *click* sound would be loudly heard. Minor concern, didn’t give much to it; Now, after the driver not being recognized and all of that, the PC won’t even shut down. The fans and RGB are still working and I have to unplug it, which is oddly weird. I think that something is messed up but I have no idea why.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Need some help trying to figure out of the lag my friend/roommate is experiencing is because of the PC and how it is setup or if it is the server which is causing the lag. 

The game where he is experiencing the lag is warzone and haven't tested any other games yet (newer PC so not a lot of gameplay on it yet). The PC is a brand new build with ASUS X-570, RYZEN 5 3600x, RTX 2060 super and 16GB 3200mhz of Ram and was built less than a month ago and paired with a 60hz monitor. The PC is plugged directly into the modem and internet download speeds are in the 180-220 mbps range, and during gameplay the latency is 20-30ms (ignoring the gameplays where the ping will jump for random reasons where lag is expected). Have set the RAM speeds in Bios, installed drivers for the RTX 2060 super, but haven't done a motherboard update yet.

The reason why I am curious to know if the PC is contributing to the lag is because we play on the same network in the house, and yet he will experience lag when I don't. We normally play during the hours of 8pm till midnight. I play on my PC as well (i7 8700, 1660ti, and 322gb RAM) using a google mesh wifi point that I plugged into. He will have no background apps running, while I will have google chrome with multiple tabs and a few other background apps running while playing. It seems like their is no difference in who is host in terms of when the lag will affect my roomate. So is there anything we can do PC wise to fix the lag is or is it on the server side to which cause the lag?

I had a few issues after install where I had to short the CMOS to get the PC to boot past VGA, but otherwise it was fine, until recently - every so often my pc now shuts off (displays go black, no signal) and the GPU fans speed up to 100%. It stays like this until I turn it off or restart. One time after it did this, it encountered the same error of not booting past VGA, and another time it booted to the windows screen saying it had failed to load or whatever. These crashes are unrelated to load, and have happened while idle on the desktop with no apps open other than chrome. Yesterday I managed to play \~2 hours of Apex Legends on the highest settings with no issues. Presumably if it was a power or thermal issue it wouldn't be able to tolerate higher strain without shutting off in the same way.

I'm not really sure what could be the problem. I was sure the PSU supplied enough power, but maybe not? Specs below. More than happy for any advice you guys can provide. I just updated the BIOS on my motherboard, hoping that would help, but now it encounters the same error on boot - stuck at VGA. I'll probably have to short the CMOS again to get it to boot properly.

Hello friends, I've been experiencing continuous drops in fps, stuttering, screen tearing and input lag -among other problems- forever. I've been troubleshooting this problem for a year, I've put my limited knowledge and the might of the internet to fix this. I don't know what to do from here. Name a solution and I've probably tried it. I've recently spent a lot of time cleaning up my ssd and hard drive, uninstalling fluff that came with my laptop or stuff i didn't need (and didn't know i had). Drivers, OS, Background processes, apps, everything pertinent has been updated or optimized. The only thing I know for sure that I haven't tried is changing my entire peripheral setup (HyperX), but I can't see that being the problem. I'm not super knowledgeable about computers but putting every resource at my disposal towards fixing this issue SHOULD have worked. I'm sure this is fixable.   


This is not an isolated issue to any one game, stuff just don't run well for me. There's obviously something very wrong all around, but it's been truly tragic on Destiny 2 which I've heard is one of the best optimized games out there and my setup should easily run. Speaking of, my rig consists of the following according to GeForce Experience because I'm not good at remembering specs:

I'm at a complete loss and not sure how to diagnose this issue if I can't get any display working. 

The PC will restart, and all inside components appear to light up and work properly when doing so. 

(I'm confident it's not the cables as BOTH monitors Lost display signal at the same time. Also one monitor is a 2K 144Hz DP - DP, the other is a 1080p, 60Hz DVI - DP.) 

I'm worried it's a GPU fault, if so, is there a way to fix which won't result in me having to buy a new one, because I bought it not too long ago?

&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;#39;m confident it&amp;#39;s not the cables as BOTH monitors Lost display signal at the same time. Also one monitor is a 2K 144Hz DP - DP, the other is a 1080p, 60Hz DVI - DP.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m worried it&amp;#39;s a GPU fault, if so, is there a way to fix which won&amp;#39;t result in me having to buy a new one, because I bought it not too long ago?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monitor one: MSI Optic MAG271CQR 
Monitor two: Acer S220HQL
Motherboard: Aorus X570 AUROS ELITE
GPU: Gigabyte RTX 2080 Super
CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 3900X&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need any more I do, don&amp;#39;t hesitate to ask.
Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I haven&amp;#39;t got any results from userbenchmark test or DDU (as per the rules) because I can&amp;#39;t get my monitors to get any signal so cannot procede with testing this software.&lt;/p&gt;

Hello all,

I recently built a a new CPU. Here is the list of parts [https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/9kwh7X](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/9kwh7X). Everything is working fine I can play YouTube, open a billion tabs on google, use discord, etc... However, when I play games such as Monster Hunter World, FF14, or Phasmophobia the game will crash and say that I have a D3D error. I can play games like among us, and battle block theater just fine.

I am using an old hard drive that has only ever had games on it. It has never had an operating system installed. 

I notice there is some coil wine when I launch the high demand games, the resolution is off to a point where in phasmo it looks like my monitor is a phone screen, and I notice that my CPU and GPU both fly to 100% load upon launching those games followed by a crash.

I've:

Done a GPU bench mark results say its fine

Installed newest drivers

Switched GPU to max power settings

Uninstalled and Reinstalled the games

Nothing has worked

Hello all,

I hope you can hear it behind the fan noise in the video above.

I have a noise which does not come from the fans, but I think, from the power supply coils. It's like an engine revving repeatedly...woaao wooao wooaao...

My PC has only a few months, it does it from the beginning, but I just realised now...I really thought that the noise came from the neighbor's washing machine.

Do you know how to solve it? Is it related to the variable power management done by the Motherboard BIOS?

Thank you for your help!

I played through all of Portal with this controller and it worked perfectly. Now I am trying to play portal 2 and whenever I move the right stick (sight control) to look up the portal gun starts firing countiusly. I have checked the controls in the game, and blue portal is mapped to RB, but RB pauses and unpauses the game.

This was my Dad’s computer, but I inherited it when he passed recently, so I don’t know if there was any tricks he was doing.  I know it worked on Saturday when I picked it up, and it was driven straight home carefully. So I think it’s unlikely to have been damaged, but it is possible I guess.

When the computer is powered on, the CPU, Memory, and GPU lights come one briefly, then the computer appears to restart and immediately the same lights come on and go back out. The BOOT_DEV light then comes on and stays on. I expect that means the drive itself has failed, but that shouldn’t prevent the display should it?

I’ve already reseated RAM, pulled the CMOS battery, reset the CMOS. I even tried starting with no USBs or drives connected. I’ve tried both the onboard HDMI and the HDMI on the graphics card.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried unchecking the max memory box, going into bios to change ram speed, and I&amp;#39;ve taken each stick and putting it into the computer by itself.  When I only had one stick the hardware reserved memory was only at 17 mb but once I put in the second stick it went back up to 8 gb.  If anyone has any other solution I&amp;#39;m all ears, thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution: After only putting one stick in and seeing that only 17 mb were hardware reserved I realized that the problem could lie in dual channel.  So I installed my ram next to each other instead of in dual channel configuration and now I have full use of my ram.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,pcgamingtechsupport,"So I have been building computers for about seven years now and still cannot fix my problem. My computer has many different issues that seem to be related. Here is a list of symptoms:

1. Garbled Audio (randomly, usually after using the computer for a little bit but completely random)
2. Stuttering audio in youtube videos that repeats its self example: ""hello and welcome \* welcome to this \* to this post about \*about my issues\* issues"". Then when I go to restart it stays on the ""Restarting"" loading screen (This also affects the mouse which usually stutters in time with the stuttering of the video).
3. /*I think I fixed this issue by using a different usb port?*/The mouse will randomly turn off, seems to get really bad for about 5 mins (turns off for a few secs then turns back on) then the issue stops for sometimes hours.
4. Video games will freeze when the mouse turns off sometimes but videos will still play on my other monitors.
5. Random audio glitches when loading a fresh video on a new webpage.
6. Bad latency from HDaud driver, DirectX 12 driver, storport, and Nvidia drivers
7. I Use pro tools a lot (Digital audio workstation application) and I will get CPU usage errors when there is less than 50% CPU used (per core none are above 50% so it is not a core overload)

I am not getting BSOD however, so it is very hard to find answers. I have tried many solutions and none have worked:

1. Updating drivers (all kinds, with different programs and getting them from the manufacturer's website)
2. I made sure that the computer cannot put any of my USB devices or audio devices to sleep.
3. Restarting my audio interface in a temporary solution to some of the issues (garbled audio) but does not help with issue #2
4. Changing my sample rate from 48K to 44.1k and back fixed issue #2 but was only temporary

I am also not seeing any spikes with the hard disk or SSD that might cause some of these glitches. When issue # 4 happens, there is a dip in GPU usage but no spike in anything else.

I'm starting to think it might be one of my hard drives but I tried QueitHDD with no help. Also, the hard drive with no programs on it (my backup drive for music projects) is the one I am concerned about since it is the oldest but it just doesn't make sense to me.

Any help with this is very much appreciated! I have been dealing with these issues for months now and similar issues for years (bad audio glitches).

,pcgamingtechsupport,"So like I said in the title, I woke up a few days ago and found my pc just severely under performing while playing games. GTA V went from like 90fps average to 40 while driving, DMC5 loads slower and stutters a bit, Dead by Daylight barely runs at 50fps at medium settings and occasionally and seemingly randomly drops to the 20s etc. I actually have no idea what is causing this. Another thing to add is that in DMC lowering the settings didn't do anything, nor did it do anything in GTA.

Things I did: Updating drivers, checked temperatures (nothing out of the ordinary), moved the game from my slower hard drive to a faster one, updated windows (this didn't happen after a windows update).

I bought an nvidia GT 710 and I'm confident it works. My motherboard is an ASROCK b550m pro4 which has a PCIe 4.0 x16 and a PCIe 3.0 x16. The 2070s is in the 4x16 slot and when I plugged in the 3x16 slot, I can see that the 710 is recognized when checking nvidia-smi. However, when I plug any monitor into the 710, nothing happens.

I know the GT 710 works because I put it into the 4.0 x16 slot and video worked fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anybody have any experience with these types of problems?",t2_5x6c4,False,,0,False,"2nd GPU recognized, but has no video output","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Hardware'}]",r/pcgamingtechsupport,False,6,Hardware,0,,,False,t3_jxj0r5,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Hardware,False,1,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1605877520.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.pcgamingtechsupport,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this isn&amp;#39;t the right place to ask this question, I would greatly appreciate being pointed towards a more appropriate subreddit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;RAM not as fast as it could be&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Check your BIOS/UEFI settings for a &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_presence_detect#XMP""&gt;XMP&lt;/a&gt; Setting. Many systems have it disabled by default.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Enable XMP&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;GPU/CPU is getting too hot&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Airflow is suboptimal? Check out &lt;a href=""https://computerinfobits.com/pc-airflow-optimization/""&gt;this Guide&lt;/a&gt; on how to improve it&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Improve airflow inside your case&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Bad FPS after swapping GPU&amp;#39;s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Check to make sure your HDMI or DisplayPort Cable is plugged in correctly.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Your monitor should connect to your GPU, not your onboard video card.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Bad everything after cloning a drive that had your OS on it&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Stop cloning and reinstall windows.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;seriously, stop cloning your OS drives people&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Clicking noise&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;check for lose wires, locate the sound&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Whatever clicks, if its not a cable hitting a fan, replace that part ASAP.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;PC randomly restarts&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Remove recently added parts and see if the problem persists. If it does, replace all parts one by one in this order of probability -&amp;gt; RAM, PSU, MoBo, CPU, EndUser&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Replace faulty hardware&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Bad smell&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Do not touch a thing, unplug the maschine from power and call an expert. We know gaming is fun, but its not worth your life.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Current can kill, call an expert for your own safety when dealing with possible short-circuited hardware.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;BlueScreen&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Find out what the BSOD Code means and act accordingly. We recommend using &lt;a href=""https://www.lifewire.com/blue-screen-error-codes-4065576""&gt;this list of BSOD Codes&lt;/a&gt; for investigation.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Replace or repair faulty soft or hardware.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;BlueScreen - Advanced&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Every BlueScreen will (if this function is enabled on your maschine) produce a &amp;quot;minidump&amp;quot;. Which is similar to an error log. This Topic however is a bit complicated, so we recommend following &lt;a href=""https://itstillworks.com/12208748/how-to-read-blue-screen-of-death-minidump-files""&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Replace or repair faulty soft or hardware.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;em&gt;to be continued&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;if anyone has anymore ideas for possible, generic workflows, let us know via modmail&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

,pcgamingtechsupport," Hi there,  


Looking for some help with my Alienware 17 R4, getting hopeless. Although I've made slight improvements with things like changing options in bios, throttlestop disabling BD PROCHOT, undervolting, changing power management percentage, monitoring temps and usuage using mwinfo etc etc etc. So It appears when I clock my 2.8ghz to 3.5-3.6ghz I get the same performance in HEAVEN benchmark as when it's at 2.8, except my temps get up to over 90 degrees celcius. So that's why I put my power management down to 85-90%, and my temps remain in the 80s, and my performance is very similar.  


I don't quite seem to be getting the same performance I use to be getting while gaming (warzone and pubg).  


Just today I ran LatencyMon and noticed I Was getting some really high numbers, so I disabled a couple dell drivers and seen the battery ACPI was giving me high numbers so I disabled that. That seemed to improve performance slightly, but doing all this seems like its just a bandage to my situation and I'm not resolving the root cause. Considering I use to get much better performance, I'm not sure what it could be.  


My 17 R4 specs are as followed;  
AMD Radeon(TM) RX 570 with 8GB GDDR5  
16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 at 2400MHz  
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ (Q uad-Core, 6MB Cache, up to 3.8 GHz w/ Turbo Boost)

Well, I removed my storage devices and I was still getting that screen, so I figured I'd remove the ram and put it back to see if that did anything. Now when I boot, the onboard LEDs on the mobo can't get past the first yellow DRAM light, and I get no screen at all. Thoughts?

Specs:

- AMD Ryzen 5 3600
- Pulse Sapphire RX5600XT
- Asus TUF Gaming X570-Plus Wifi
- Seasonic S12III-650
- Corsair MP600 1TB NVME
- G.SKILL Ripjaws DDR4-3600 8gbx2

EDIT: I tried to boot with only one of the ram sticks at a time in the recommended slot. For one of the sticks, I got stuck at the DRAM led and saw no signal detected on the screen, for the other stick, I got that purple screen again. I'm guessing the ram is the problem?

EDIT 2: I tried it again because I wasn't convinced I had the ram properly seated and both sticks of ram seem to be giving that purple screen now.

Steps I have attempted:

Cloned the drive using both EaseUS Partition Master and Acronis with no luck.

I have attempted a clean install

updated the bios to the most recent version

flashed the CMOS

,pcgamingtechsupport,"I have a Frankenstein PC made up of whatever I got cheaply over the last 10 years or so.  So it's not really surprising it has issues.  But I thought I'd see if anyone has a recommendation, aside from just, ""buy a new one."" :D

A friend of mine was getting rid of his GeForce GTX 760, so I recently stuck that in.  It's taking a lot more power than my previous GTX 650Ti.  That brought me up to just meet the minimum requirements to play ""Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.""  So I downloaded that and have been trying to play it.  But the whole computer shuts off once the game starts at 1080p.  I turned down the resolution a bit to 900p, and was able to play the first level until the boss.  Once the boss appeared it blinked off again.

Other intensive games don't work either, I can't even get to the main menu of Overload for some reason.  But Tempest 4000 works.

When it turns off I can't turn it immediately back on.  I have to pull the plug and wait a few seconds.  According to Open Hardware Monitor, all the temperatures on the board are fine. (There doesn't seem to be a power supply sensor).

The power supply should be enough to handle the load according to [https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator](https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator) anyway.  It's a 600W supply, but it's quite old.  Probably purchased in late 2011.  The fan seems to be running fine though, and it isn't noticeably hot.

So I'm guessing power supply issue?  Anyone have other ideas?

PSU / CPU / RAMS /

It's a long story and i know how to build pcs and i'm a intermediate but this pc has a problem in the motherboard, i decided to remove the heatsink from the ""NorthBridge"" and now it doesnt shut down usually , Before it was turning off in 5minutes but now the pc can last for 3hours... I want to know if this bridge need a heatsink or it's okay to run without it? And i'd like to know if there is any software that gives NorthBridge Temperature .

The way I can most easily replicate it is 1) using folding at home to get to full GPU load, 2) using firefox to do something like watch a youtube video, and 3) start Davinci Resolve, hitting the CPU.

NOTHING is overclocked (yet) and XMP is disabled (for the moment)

Is this possibly a driver issue, or is it a power issue? I thought a good 750W PSU would be plenty for the 3070, but this really feels like a PSU problem..... but that is surprising to me. Everything should be up to date within a few weeks as far as drivers. I would blame Davinci, but the crashing to off instead of just a software crash is confusing.

So far I have restarted, shut down, and booted in safe mode. None of which have worked.

I’m pretty confident it is not a hardware related issue but rather a software one as all of my parts have their lights on and fans spinning, as well as my ability to move my mouse cursor and press control+alt+del to enter the lock screen again while in that black screen.

Hello,
I needed some information. I purchased the following notebook with the black friday offers for 1000€: 

Lenovo Legion 5 Notebook Gaming, Display 15.6"" Full HD IPS 120Hz, Processore AMD Ryzen 7 4800H, 512 GB SSD, RAM 16GB, Scheda grafica NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 6GB GDDR6

I would like to know if the display is really that bad for gaming and if eventually it could be replaced with a better one, maybe from 144Hz

15.6"" (396mm) FHD (1920x1080), anti-glare, LED backlight, WVA, 250 nits, 16:9 aspect ratio, 45% NTSC gamut, refresh rate 120 Hz

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Just recently built my pc with a Ryzen 7  3700x, RTX 2080 S, 16Gb  of ram, b550 Mobo, it’s a powerful computer you  get the idea. Running  at 1440p at 144hz on an LG 27GL850

However  I’ve noticed  I get these microstutters/ FPS lags across all my games, no matter if it’s a  game like COD, Squad, Rust or a less demanding game like rouge company  or some RTS titles. I will be playing at 100+fps and every few minutes my FPS drops down to 10-20fps and even single digits for 3-4 seconds. It's really starting to bother me because a pc like this should not be struggling.

Checked  my  Nvidia driver and I have the most recent, my temps are fine I monitor them with HWinfo, no overheating. My GPU dosesn't break 70 Degrees C even while gaming for hours. I have all Win10 updates so everything seems to be squared away. I went a good  period of time with no stutters but now all of a sudden its become an issue. Just annoying dropping from 100+ to 10-20fps for a few seconds in games. And  it's consistent too. What could be causing this issue all of a sudden?


SOLVED EDIT: So based on others who experienced the same issue it was found that I too had my background/wallpaper rotation set to “every minute”. The issue was that every time the wallpaper changed, I suffered a FPS lag. This was confirmed after a little test where the time interval between each FPS drop was about 60 seconds which lined up with the change in wallpapers. I changed my wallpaper rotation to once a day and now I am NOT experiencing consistent FPS drops. Thank you guys!!!

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hello all! My buddy and I have been stuck trying to figure out why his i5-8600k won’t turbo and will sometimes actually under clock. We ended up at a stable 4.6GHz over clock (as it’s his first time and didn’t want to overshoot and cause anxiety). When paired with a 3070 we noticed some performance issues and decided we could stabilize at 4.8GHz this was achieved and worked flawlessly. We came to the conclusion it was a GPU driver issue and left it at that. After updating NVIDIA drivers we have come to the issue of the 8600k under clocking at anywhere from 0.8-3.2GHz. We’ve since gotten to reach the base frequency WITHOUT turbo. When turbo is enabled and even OC’ing to 4.3GHz (the rated turbo frequency) the CPU clocks at 3.6GHz and no higher.

My buddy and I have been stuck trying to figure out why his i5-8600k won’t turbo and will sometimes actually under clock. We ended up at a stable 4.6GHz over clock (as it’s his first time and didn’t want to overshoot and cause anxiety). When paired with a 3070 we noticed some performance issues and decided we could stabilize at 4.8GHz this was achieved and worked flawlessly. We came to the conclusion it was a GPU driver issue and left it at that. After updating NVIDIA drivers we have come to the issue of the 8600k under clocking at anywhere from 0.8-3.2GHz. We’ve since gotten to reach the base frequency WITHOUT turbo. When turbo is enabled and even OC’ing to 4.3GHz (the rated turbo frequency) the CPU clocks at 3.6GHz and no higher. We flashed to v1.13 Bios and to no avail have run into the under clock again. We’ve reset the cmos, switched to the secondary bios, I’ve done extensive research and have come up with nothing.

Some quick system info:
MOBO Asus Prime Z390-A
CPU Intel® Core™ i7-9700K CPU @ 3.60GHz
GPU EVGA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER (Part number: 08G-P4-3062-RX.)
RAM 2x8 Corsair Vengeance

So I was finally able to finish my build last week. I decided to test out my Oculus Rift S and was confused why it was not connecting through either of my display ports ( I use HDMI for my monitor so never checked my DPs when I first received the card) My first theory is that it was the shitty Oculus software / the headset itself. So I took my Rift S to a buddies place and it worked instantly.

After getting back to my place I then tried using display port for my monitor and found out that wasn't getting any signal at all. I've browsed these forums and came across multiple articles just like these but none of the ""fixes"" that are offered seem to help.

I am begging to think both display ports on the card are faulty/stopped working. I looked into VBIOS updates but there is no updated software for the card anywhere. I've also adjusted multiple power settings, re-seated the GPU itself and fully removed all software via DDU. I've contacted EVGA and have had no response.

I hate being the person to ask for help on this and add another article to these forums but I have been at this for two days and have found nothing that will help.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hey,

I was trying to overclock my CPU (AMD Ryzen 5 1600) to it's boost clock of 3.6 GHz.

When I filled in the new clock I exited and saved. (MSI click bios 5)

When the pc restarted I decided to go to the task manager to see if it was running at 3.6 GHz it's boost clock. 

And i was surprised when I read it was running at 1.38 GHz. That's even far below it's base clock of 3.20 GHz.

So now I don't know what the problem is and i would really like to fix it so that I can run it at it's boost clock.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Before anything else, I reinstalled this pump back onto the original Asus X99 motherboard it came off and it functions properly on that motherboard. Pump failure is not my issue and I took the time to verify that the pump does in fact still work. I borrowed another Corsair H115i AIO from a friend, installed it and it also does not operate on the MSI mobo, but works properly on the ASUS X99 mobo.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I know this is a long post but I want to put up all the info I have to avoid suggestions I've already implemented. I appreciate any help offered as I've run out of ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a new build, and Windows is not yet installed. The system posts properly and I can enter BIOS. All case fans operate properly and as the CPU temps rise the case fans are all ramping up as they are supposed to. Only the AIO pump does not operate as it should.

&amp;#x200B;

The cooler is a Corsair H110i GTX. It's old, I know, but it looks good with the new parts and more importantly it still does a good job with no air bubble noise. I would prefer not to replace it if I can avoid it. The cost isn't my concern, rather the quality of newer AIOs I've looked at is much lower and they all look pretty awful, hence my decision to try to reuse this one.

&amp;#x200B;

The cooler has 4 leads. The USB lead I have plugged into JUSB1 header. The Sata power lead is plugged into the PSU through a SATA power cable. The fan lead splits to run the radiator's two 140mm fans. The single wire ending in a 3-pin plug is connected to the CPU\_Fan\_1 header.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the same way I installed it on my previous X99 mobo. But my results are not the same on the MSI motherboard and I can't seem to figure out why.

&amp;#x200B;

* The Corsair logo illuminates properly. 
* The radiator fans both activate properly.
* The pump does not activate.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately without the pump I have a limited time to fart around in the MSI bios which I am very unfamiliar with. I'd also prefer not not run the CPU at 100C while fumbling around. Of course since there is a ticking clock as soon as I turn on the PC my IQ is reduced by half and I lose my ability to control a mouse because reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

What I have already managed to try based on local suggestions:

* Connect a regular fan to CPU\_Fan\_1 to see if a fan runs off that header. Fan operates properly, header is not faulty.
* Connect the AIO pump 3-pin lead to the PUMP\_FAN1 header. No change, PUMP\_FAN1 header will also operate a fan properly and is not faulty.
* Connect the AIO pump 3-pin lead to a SYS\_FAN lead. No change.
* Connect the AIO pump 3-pin lead to the PSU directly using a molex to 3-pin adapter. No change, using voltage tester direct power from the Molex plug is not 12V. I believe the pump needs a 12V signal. 
* In BIOS switch fan from PWM to DC. I have done this but unlike the BIOS in my previous PC there is no ""apply"" button so I'm not sure the changes I'm making are even taking effect.
* Allow the CPU to reach higher temps to see if the pump kicks in at higher temps - Eventually I get a message that the CPU is overheating and the PC shuts down. I would prefer not to have that happen again and would prefer not to even attempt another similar strategy.
* In BIOS switch the voltage manually to 12V. I've entered BIOS several times and as I am unfamiliar with the MSI BIOS have not found how/where to do this. The CPU temps start climbing over 90C and I have to shut down.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on about 6 hours of reading last night, I'm thinking the AIO waterpump needs a 12V signal to activate and is not getting a full 12V signal. The waterpump should be running 100% at all times unlike the fans and requires a simple 12V signal to activate. The mobo does not support my ancient AIO because it doesn't use the current standard AIO  hookup. As the signal cable connected to CPU\_FAN\_1 is a single one direction signal wire , the mobo is not detecting power draw from CPU\_Fan\_1 and therefore is not sending a signal to the pump to fire up.

&amp;#x200B;

If there is not way to do this through BIOS is there something I can wire up to send a 12V signal to the pump whenever the system is on so that it comes on regardless of what the motherboard is up to?

&amp;#x200B;

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Good day,

I have been struggling to figure out what’s been happening. For almost two weeks now my games are constantly crashing. My gpu is a 2070 and it’s working properly, I have ran couple hours of benchmarks. The cpu is a 3700x, I have ran prime95 and haven’t found any errors on that either. I have 16gb ram, did memtest86 nothing wrong. 

I play video games and record them as well as editing and rendering while getting uploaded to YouTube. My pc was perfectly fine October, before the November Windows update and Nvidia update happened.

&lt;p&gt;I have been struggling to figure out what’s been happening. For almost two weeks now my games are constantly crashing. My gpu is a 2070 and it’s working properly, I have ran couple hours of benchmarks. The cpu is a 3700x, I have ran prime95 and haven’t found any errors on that either. I have 16gb ram, did memtest86 nothing wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I play video games and record them as well as editing and rendering while getting uploaded to YouTube. My pc was perfectly fine October, before the November Windows update and Nvidia update happened. I have since factory reset my pc thinking it was an installation error. But still nothing. I’m about to give up on this&lt;/p&gt;

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hello guys

Im experience some difficulties capturing gameplays with my PS5.

For to make use of my Astro A50’s 4th Gen i need a HDMI splitter from Elgato. Since the PS5 has no optical input.

I hooked everything up, set the video settings in my ps5 to 1080p. 

Opened the 4k program from elgato, nothing wrong
But when i check the display information on my LG 27GN950 (information on the screen it self) it shows 1080p 60hz

This doesn’t happen when i dont connect the 4k60pro.
The. It shows its 120hz at 1080p

Everything is hooked as it should. 

Hdmi goes from my ps5 to hdmi IN on the splitter, hdmi out from the splitter goes to the elgato IN, hdmi cable goes from elgato OUT to my monitor.

Without using the elgato, the display information shows 1080p 120hz

Sometimes i play 4k games on my ps5 at 60hz and that works smooth without issues, capturing works greats.

Is this problem on my side or does the 4k60 pro doesn’t support 120hz? On the website it can handle 1080p 240hz , 1440p 144hz and 4k on 60hz

Hey all,

So I noticed this issue a few days ago and can’t seem to figure it out. When playing on my PC there seems to be this issue where there is this very faint stuttering randomly. It’s most noticeable in Destiny 2 when looks around. It’s very faint and frame rate doesn’t drop when it happens. I’m also scoring very low on user benchmark. 16 to 18 percent in graphics. I have tried running games as admin. Turning windows game recording off. Used DDU to uninstall all drivers and reinstall. I’ve tried messing with just about every game setting. My GPU isn’t overheating at all according to MSI afterburner. I’ve ran Kombuster and it holds up fine. Any ideas of what to do?

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi everyone!

I know there have been plenty of posts on this general topic, but even through doing my due diligence I feel like I can't get a clear answer given my particular rig and scenario. 

Basically, please with some basic logic behind it, help me understand if and how high I need to be capping my FPS and why that will benefit me. 


**Relevant Parts of My Setup:**

Intel Core i7-10700 

MSI Z490 Motherboard

2080 Super 8 GB 

Dell S2719DGF 27.0"" 1440p, 144hz, freesync NOT gsync Monitor

**My current conclusion:** 

Since I have a 144hz freesync monitor, and a 2080 super + high end CPU, I should be able to push 144 fine in most competitive fps with settings on low. My main goal is max &amp; most *consistent* framerate. So, I use NVIDIA control panel to hard cap my output at 143fps. I leave framerate in-game uncapped if possible, or as high as custom will go. V-sync off, freesync on. This should allow the game to pump as many frames as possible while hard capping ensures my monitor stays at just below the max refresh rate for most conistency in framerate. 

However, I'm not sure that capping my fps seems to have made things FEEL smoother. But I do feel like I notice less drops? I'm just unsure and that's why I want an actual concrete understanding.

Should I cap it in some games and not others? If I can or cannot push 144? For instance, I have no problem pushing 144 in most games, if not well over that. Like valorant, rocket league, other well optimised games etc. But I can get 144 MAYBE on a good day with drops to lower hundreds in Apex and Warzone.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"so.. very odd thing happening after i installed a cpu cooler (big 2 tower air cooler).

(regular reboot option from windows works fine) but Certain reboot request don't actually reboot: when asking to reboot into uefi from windows troubleshooter option and when asking to reboot from AMD chipset installer. 

The PC doesnt Turn off completely (still see gpu rgb lights), but it doesn't reboot either and fan case rgbs never turn on and windows never loads. I have to force power off then turn on and everything works normal.

Other symptoms are that mobo data sometimes shows in HWmonitor and sometimes it doesnt (this didnt happen before, i used HW monitor constantly for like a month cause i got a new cpu and gpu)

Also, gigabyte's SIV brought up random alerts of fans under 100rpm, when i actually could see the fans still working.,

Other than that PC works fine. MOBO is gigabyte's B550M-DS3H-rev-1x.

CPU cooler installed is Phanteks PH-TC14PE.

,pcgamingtechsupport," I have a weird situation that has been around for a few months and I've tried to research extensively. If this is simple, I apologize. 

Infrequently, I will start my PC. Fans will all run. CPU fan spins at full RPM, like it always does at start. However, display is blank and the fans stay at high speed. 

I have already assured the ram is tight to the motherboard (I was having problems with loose ram a while back. Fixed that issue but the original remains)

Cycling power always fixes this issue, but I'd like to get to the bottom of it.

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi guys,

For the context, I bought a new laptop right before the lockdown got announced, so I didn’t use it that much for the last 6 months (it has 16 days worked in total). 

The problem is that sometimes some artifacts appear on the screen for a fraction af a second.
Tbh there were more frequent artifacts on the screen before checking all the right drivers. However, even now I get some small artifacts. 

What can I do to troubleshoot the problem and maybe give it back to the store to fix it (if I can’t)?

,pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi guys, since yesterday i have a strange problem with my gpu fans. While i was gaming, my rx 480 fans started pumping at max speed for extended periods of time. I checked gpu temps and they never went above 68 ° C. The fans spun even after closing the game, with my gpu hovering around 40°C. Only after like 2 minutes they went quiet again. What's worse is that now my fans start spinning at max speed as soon as i boot the pc and they don't stop. I hope that my fan controller didn't blow up or something. 

Of course, i have no kind of overclocking going on, both my cpu and gpu are at stock speeds. The problem was there both with manual fan control from radeon app and default settings applied. Also another thing to note is that right now Radeon app doesn't show my gpu fans rpm. It says that they are stuck at 0 rpm which is of course not true at all since they are going at full speed. I don't use msi afterburner, the only external monitoring programm that i have is hwmonitor, which i unistalled to see if it was affecting something. A thing to note is that hwmonitor didn't show my gpu fan speed (something that always did normally) which adds to the Radeon app showing me the 0 rpm thing.

so 2 months ago i recived my custom build. Everything watercooled.

And they did a great job with everything, there is just this one issue.

The GPU watercooling block looks like there is building dirt inside of it.

Its not where the flow is happening. So I´m guessing its dust?

Motherboard: MSI MPG x570 GAMING EDGE WIFI

CPU: Ryzen 9 3900x

GPU: MSI RTX 2070 GAMING Z

RAM: 64gb 3200MHz Vengeance RGB Pro

Display: Acer Predator XB273K (4k @ 144hz)

Storage: All SSD, 2 SanDisk Ultras + M.2 for Windows Install

\-

My issue is that whenever I try to launch an application-usually a game-I experience some sort of issue, with varying problems. Some examples:

Launching Overwatch will cause my computer to constantly dip to 10-20fps and stutter for about 5 minutes, then afterwards my computer plays the game like normal. My color settings in NVIDIA control panel also are automatically changed every time.

Launching Borderlands 3 will give some minor stutters and dips in FPS, however when tabbing into Epic Games, my computer can sometimes become unresponsive for a few seconds at a time. Will act normally when tabbed back into the game.

\-

I feel like I have exhausted just about all of my options. I have tried running games at different resolutions, changing the resolution in Windows, turning HDR on and off, uninstalling and reinstalling the games that had given me issue, running hardware scans, yet nothing really seems to make any noticeable difference in performance. My only other thought is that it's maybe some sort of bottleneck? I know the 2070 isn't really meant for 4k gaming, and aside from some smaller, less demanding titles, I'm still setting my games at 1080p or 1440p. The other thing that has me completely confused is that there's a lot of titles or applications that have no issues whatsoever, even when ran in 4k HDR, which makes me think that it's not a hardware issue. But I could be wrong.

I've just been extremely frustrated, as I've put a lot of money into this rig, only for it to barely work at times, even though it's got some quality parts in there. And while I mentioned my suspicion of it possibly being a bottleneck, I don't want to shell out over a grand on an Ampere card, only for that to not be the issue and still be in the same situation that I'm in now. So if anybody has any ideas as to what my issue would be, I would greatly appreciate it.

The F11i version.

after that i started building and now when i press the power button, it turns on but there is no screen.

I tried to reset CMOS but it did not help. Anyone please help.

Also when i try to longpress the power button to shut the pc down, nothing happens. the power button just blinks

Maybe CPU dead? It accidentaly came out when i tried to take out my cpu cooler but could that have been the reason to break it? the pins look good so i dont think thats the reason.

what can i do?

So I feel like I'm going insane rn. For some reason, no matter what I do, LA Noire doesn't seem to fully register that I'm using a controller. I have a PS4 controller and every other game seems to register it just fine, by register I mean Steam automatically translates the PS4 controller inputs as Xbox 360 controller inputs. But for some reason when I try playing LA Noire, it seems to only register it as a controller if I'm moving the left analog stick up and down, but when I press any button the icons quickly switch back to keyboard icons as if I'm using a mouse and keyboard and what I'm pressing does nothing.

This is so frustrating because literally yesterday it didn't have this problem and worked perfectly, but it had another issue so I had to reinstall the game on my steam. Now that I've reinstalled it the other issue is gone but now I have this controller issue.

I assume this is an issue with my video card, which I haven't upgraded in some years, but I figured I'd ask y'all if this is obviously some other issue that I'm just not thinking of or if there is some easy diagnosis method to verify if the card is functioning normally.

Long story short - is it worth getting something now, like a 2070 (normal 2080s are in stock, but are 1100$ in my country KEKW)  or waiting... i estimate around 4 months for prices to cool, and get a 3070?
